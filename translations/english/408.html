<p class="verse"><a name="30:34" />34: showing no gratitude for what We have given them. &lsquo;Take your pleasure! You will come to know.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:35" />35: Did We send them down any authority that sanctions the partners they ascribe to God?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:36" />36: When We give people a taste of Our blessing, they rejoice, but when something bad happens to them- because of their own actions- they fall into utter despair.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:37" />37: Do they not see that God gives abundantly to whoever He will and sparingly [to whoever He will]? There truly are signs in this for those who believe.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:38" />38: So give their due to the near relative, the needy, and the wayfarer- that is best for those whose goal is God&rsquo;s approval: these are the ones who will prosper.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:39" />39: Whatever you lend out in usury to gain value through other people&rsquo;s wealth will not increase in God&rsquo;s eyes, but whatever you give in charity, in your desire for God&rsquo;s approval, will earn multiple rewards.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:40" />40: It is God who created you and provided for you, who will cause you to die and then give you life again. Which of your &lsquo;partners&rsquo; can do any one of these things? Glory be to God, and exalted be He above the partners they attribute to Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:41" />41: Corruption has flourished on land and sea as a result of people&rsquo;s actions and He will make them taste the consequences of some of their own actions so that they may turn back.</p>
