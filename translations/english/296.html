<p class="verse"><a name="18:21" />21: In this way We brought them to people&rsquo;s attention so that they might know that God&rsquo;s promise [of resurrection] is true and that there is no doubt about the Last Hour, [though] people argue among themselves. [Some] said, &lsquo;Construct a building over them: their Lord knows best about them.&rsquo; Those who prevailed said, &lsquo;We shall build a place of worship over them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:22" />22: [Some] say, &lsquo;The sleepers were three, and their dog made four,&rsquo; others say, &lsquo;They were five, and the dog made six&rsquo;- guessing in the dark- and some say, &lsquo;They were seven, and their dog made eight.&rsquo; Say [Prophet], &lsquo;My Lord knows best how many they were.&rsquo; Only a few have real knowledge about them, so do not argue, but stick to what is clear, and do not ask any of these people about them;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:23" />23: do not say of anything, &lsquo;I will do that tomorrow,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:24" />24: without adding, &lsquo;God willing,&rsquo; and, whenever you forget, remember your Lord and say, &lsquo;May my Lord guide me closer to what is right.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:25" />25: [Some say], &lsquo;The sleepers stayed in their cave for three hundred years,&rsquo; some added nine more.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:26" />26: Say [Prophet], &lsquo;God knows best how long they stayed.&rsquo; His is the knowledge of all that is hidden in the heavens and earth- How well He sees! How well He hears!- and they have no one to protect them other than Him; He does not allow anyone to share His rule.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:27" />27: [Prophet], follow what has been revealed to you of your Lord&rsquo;s Scripture: there is no changing His words, nor can you find any refuge except with Him.</p>
