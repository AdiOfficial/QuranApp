<p class="verse"><a name="36:71" />71: Can they not see how, among the things made by Our hands, We have created livestock they control,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:72" />72: and made them obedient, so that some can be used for riding, some for food,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:73" />73: some for other benefits, and some for drink? Will they not give thanks?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:74" />74: Yet they have taken other gods besides God to help them,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:75" />75: though these could not do so even if they called a whole army of them together!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:76" />76: So [Prophet] do not be distressed at what they say: We know what they conceal and what they reveal.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:77" />77: Can man not see that We created him from a drop of fluid? Yet- lo and behold!- he disputes openly,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:78" />78: producing arguments against Us, forgetting his own creation. He says, &lsquo;Who can give life back to bones after they have decayed?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:79" />79: Say, &lsquo;He who created them in the first place will give them life again: He has full knowledge of every act of creation.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:80" />80: It is He who produces fire for you out of the green tree- lo and behold!- and from this you kindle fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:81" />81: Is He who created the heavens and earth not able to create the likes of these people? Of course He is! He is the All Knowing Creator:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:82" />82: when He wills something to be, His way is to say, &ldquo;Be&rdquo;- and it is!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:83" />83: So glory be to Him in whose Hand lies control over all things. It is to Him that you will all be brought back.&rsquo;</p>
