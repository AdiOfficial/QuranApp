<p class="verse"><a name="20:88" />88: but he [used the molten jewellery to] produce an image of a calf which made a lowing sound, and they said, &lsquo;This is your god and Moses&rsquo; god, but he has forgotten.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:89" />89: Did they not see that [the calf] gave them no answer, that it had no power to harm or benefit them?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:90" />90: Aaron did say to them, &lsquo;My people, this calf is a test for you. Your true Lord is the Lord of Mercy, so follow me and obey my orders,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:91" />91: but they replied, &lsquo;We shall not give up our devotion to it until Moses returns to us.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:92" />92: Moses said, &lsquo;When you realized they had gone astray, what prevented you, Aaron,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:93" />93: from coming after me? How could you disobey my orders?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:94" />94: He said, &lsquo;Son of my mother- let go of my beard and my hair!- I was afraid you would say, &ldquo;You have caused division among the children of Israel and have not heeded what I said.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:95" />95: Moses said, &lsquo;And what was the matter with you, Samiri?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:96" />96: He replied, &lsquo;I saw something they did not; I took in some of the teachings of the Messenger but tossed them aside: my soul prompted me to do what I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:97" />97: Moses said, &lsquo;Get away from here! Your lot in this life is to say, &ldquo;Do not touch me,&rdquo; but you have an appointment from which there is no escape. Look at your god which you have kept on worshipping- we shall grind it down and scatter it into the sea.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:98" />98: [People], your true god is the One God- there is no god but Him- whose knowledge embraces everything.&rsquo;</p>
