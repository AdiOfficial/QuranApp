<p class="verse"><a name="26:40" />40: &lsquo;Are you all coming? We may follow the sorcerers if they win!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:41" />41: When the sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh, &lsquo;Shall we be rewarded if we win?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:42" />42: and he said, &lsquo;Yes, and you will join my inner court.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:43" />43: Moses said to them, &lsquo;Throw down whatever you will.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:44" />44: They threw their ropes and staffs, saying, &lsquo;By Pharaoh&rsquo;s might, we shall be victorious.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:45" />45: But Moses threw his staff and- lo and behold!- it swallowed up their trickery</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:46" />46: and the sorcerers fell down on their knees,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:47" />47: exclaiming, &lsquo;We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:48" />48: the Lord of Moses and Aaron.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:49" />49: Pharaoh said, &lsquo;How dare you believe in him before I have given you permission? He must be the master who taught you sorcery! Soon you will see: I will cut off your alternate hands and feet and then crucify the lot of you!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:50" />50: &lsquo;That will do us no harm,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;for we are sure to return to our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:51" />51: We hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, as we were the first to believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:52" />52: Then We revealed Our will to Moses, &lsquo;Leave with My servants by night, for you will be pursued!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:53" />53: Pharaoh sent messengers into the cities, proclaiming,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:54" />54: &lsquo;These people are a puny band&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:55" />55: they have enraged us-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:56" />56: and we are a large army, on the alert.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:57" />57: So it was that We made them leave their gardens and their springs,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:58" />58: their treasures and their noble dwellings-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:59" />59: We gave [such] things [later]to the Children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:60" />60: Pharaoh and his people pursued them at sunrise,</p>
