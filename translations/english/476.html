<p class="verse"><a name="40:78" />78: We have sent other messengers before you- some We have mentioned to you and some We have not- and no messenger could bring about a sign except with God&rsquo;s permission. When [the Day] God ordained comes, just judgement will be passed between them: there and then, those who followed falsehood will be lost.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:79" />79: It is God who provides livestock for you, some for riding and some for your food;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:80" />80: you have other benefits in them too. You can reach any destination you wish on them: they carry you, as ships carry you [on the sea].</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:81" />81: He shows you His signs: which of God&rsquo;s signs do you still ignore?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:82" />82: Have they not travelled through the land and seen how those who lived before them met their end? They were more numerous than them, stronger than them, and made a more impressive mark on the land, yet what they achieved was of no use to them at all.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:83" />83: When messengers came to them with clear signs, they revelled in the knowledge they had, and so they were engulfed by the very punishment they mocked:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:84" />84: when they saw Our punishment, they said, &lsquo;We believe in God alone; we reject any partner we ascribed to Him,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:85" />85: but believing after seeing Our punishment did not benefit them at all- this has always been God&rsquo;s way of dealing with His creatures- there and then the disbelievers were lost.</p>
