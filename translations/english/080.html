<p class="verse"><a name="4:15" />15: If any of your women commit a lewd act, call four witnesses from among you, then, if they testify to their guilt, keep the women at home until death comes to them or until God shows them another way.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:16" />16: If two men commit a lewd act, punish them both; if they repent and mend their ways, leave them alone- God is always ready to accept repentance, He is full of mercy.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:17" />17: But God only undertakes to accept repentance from those who do evil out of ignorance and soon afterwards repent: these are the ones God will forgive, He is all knowing, all wise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:18" />18: It is not true repentance when people continue to do evil until death confronts them and then say, &lsquo;Now I repent,&rsquo; nor when they die defiant: We have prepared a painful torment for these.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:19" />19: You who believe, it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will, nor should you treat your wives harshly, hoping to take back some of the bride-gift you gave them, unless they are guilty of something clearly outrageous. Live with them in accordance with what is fair and kind: if you dislike them, it may well be that you dislike something in which God has put much good.</p>
