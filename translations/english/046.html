<p class="verse"><a name="2:270" />270: Whatever you may give, or vow to give, God knows it well, and those who do wrong will have no one to help them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:271" />271: If you give charity openly, it is good, but if you keep it secret and give to the needy in private, that is better for you, and it will atone for some of your bad deeds: God is well aware of all that you do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:272" />272: It is not for you [Prophet] to guide them; it is God who guides whoever He will. Whatever charity you give benefits your own soul, provided you do it for the sake of God: whatever you give will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:273" />273: [Give] to those needy who are wholly occupied in God&rsquo;s way and cannot travel in the land [for trade]. The unknowing might think them rich because of their self-restraint, but you will recognize them by their characteristic of not begging persistently. God is well aware of any good you give.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:274" />274: Those who give, out of their own possessions, by night and by day, in private and in public, will have their reward with their Lord: no fear for them, nor will they grieve.</p>
