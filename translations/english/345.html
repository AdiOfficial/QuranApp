<p class="verse"><a name="23:43" />43: no community can advance or delay its time-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:44" />44: and We sent Our messengers in succession: whenever a messenger came to a community they invariably called him a liar, so We destroyed them one after the other and made them into cautionary tales. Away with the disbelievers!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:45" />45: Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron, with Our signs and clear authority,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:46" />46: to Pharaoh and his prominent leaders, but they responded with arrogance: they were a haughty people.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:47" />47: They said, &lsquo;Are we to believe in two mortals like us? And their people are our servants?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:48" />48: and so they called them both liars: they became another ruined people.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:49" />49: We gave Moses the Scripture, so that they might be rightly guided.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:50" />50: We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign; We gave them shelter on a peaceful hillside with flowing water.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:51" />51: Messengers, eat good things and do good deeds: I am well aware of what you do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:52" />52: This community of yours is one- and I am your Lord: be mindful of Me-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:53" />53: but they have split their community into sects, each rejoicing in their own.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:54" />54: So [Muhammad] leave them for a while steeped [in their ignorance].</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:55" />55: Do they reckon that, by giving them wealth and sons,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:56" />56: We race to give them good things? They really have no idea!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:57" />57: Those who stand in awe of their Lord,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:58" />58: who believe in His messages,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:59" />59: who do not ascribe partners to Him,</p>
