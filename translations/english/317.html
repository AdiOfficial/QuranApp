<p class="verse"><a name="20:77" />77: We revealed to Moses, &lsquo;Go out at night with My servants and strike a dry path for them across the sea. Have no fear of being overtaken and do not be dismayed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:78" />78: Pharaoh pursued them with his armies and was overwhelmed by the sea.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:79" />79: Pharaoh truly led his people astray; he did not guide them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:80" />80: Children of Israel, We rescued you from your enemies. We made a pledge with you on the right-hand side of the mountain. We sent down manna and quails for you,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:81" />81: &lsquo;Eat from the good things We have provided for you, but do not overstep the bounds, or My wrath will descend on you. Anyone on whom My wrath descends has truly fallen.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:82" />82: Yet I am most forgiving towards those who repent, believe, do righteous deeds, and stay on the right path.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:83" />83: [God said], &lsquo;Moses, what has made you come ahead of your people in such haste?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:84" />84: and he said, &lsquo;They are following in my footsteps. I rushed to You, Lord, to please You,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="20:85" />85: but God said, &lsquo;We have tested your people in your absence: the Samiri has led them astray.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="20:87" />87: They said, &lsquo;We did not break our word to you deliberately. We were burdened with the weight of people&rsquo;s jewellery, so we threw it [into the fire], and the Samiri did the same,&rsquo;</p>
