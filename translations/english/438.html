<p class="verse"><a name="35:31" />31: The Scripture We have revealed to you [Prophet] is the Truth and confirms the scriptures that preceded it. God is well informed about His servants, He sees everything.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:32" />32: We gave the Scripture as a heritage to Our chosen servants: some of them wronged their own souls, some stayed between [right and wrong], and some, by God&rsquo;s leave, were foremost in good deeds. That is the greatest favour:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:33" />33: they will enter lasting Gardens where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, where they will wear silk garments.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:34" />34: They will say, &lsquo;Praise be to God, who has separated us from all sorrow! Our Lord is truly most forgiving, most appreciative:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:35" />35: He has, in His bounty, settled us in the everlasting Home where no toil or fatigue will touch us.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:36" />36: But those who reject the truth will stay in Hellfire, where they will neither be finished off by death, nor be relieved from Hell&rsquo;s torment: this is how We reward hardened disbelievers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:37" />37: They will cry out loud in Hell, &lsquo;Lord, let us out, and we will do righteous deeds, not what we did before!&rsquo;- &lsquo; Did We not give you a life long enough to take warning if you were going to? The warner came to you, now taste the punishment.&rsquo; The evildoers will have nobody to help them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:38" />38: God knows all that is hidden in the heavens and earth; He knows the thoughts contained in the heart;</p>
