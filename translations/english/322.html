<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:1" />1: Ever closer to people draws their reckoning, while they turn away, heedless.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:2" />2: Whenever any fresh revelation comes to them from their Lord, they listen to it playfully</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:3" />3: with frivolous hearts. The evildoers conferred in secret: &lsquo;Is this man anything but a mortal like yourselves? Are you going to fall under his spell with your eyes wide open?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:4" />4: He said, &lsquo;My Lord knows everything that is said in the heavens and the earth: He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:5" />5: Some say, &lsquo;Muddled dreams&rsquo;; others, &lsquo;He made it up&rsquo;; yet others, &lsquo;He is just a poet, let him show us a sign as previous messengers did.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:6" />6: But of the communities We destroyed before them not a single one believed. Will these now believe?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:7" />7: And even before your time [Prophet], all the messengers We sent were only men We inspired&ndash;&ndash; if you [disbelievers] do not know, ask people who know the Scripture&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:8" />8: We did not give them bodies that ate no food, nor were they immortal.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:9" />9: We fulfilled Our promise to them in the end: We saved them and those We wished to save, and We destroyed those who exceeded all bounds.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="21:10" />10: And now We have sent down to you [people] a Scripture to remind you. Will you not use your reason?</p>
