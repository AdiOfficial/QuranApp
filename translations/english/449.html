<p class="verse"><a name="37:77" />77: We let his offspring remain on the earth,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:78" />78: We let him be praised by later generations:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:79" />79: &lsquo;Peace be upon Noah among all the nations!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:80" />80: This is how We reward those who do good:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:81" />81: he was truly one of Our faithful servants.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:82" />82: We drowned the rest.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:83" />83: Abraham was of the same faith:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:84" />84: he came to his Lord with a devoted heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:85" />85: He said to his father and his people, &lsquo;What are you worshipping?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:86" />86: How can you choose false gods instead of the true God?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:87" />87: So what is your opinion about the Lord of all the Worlds?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:88" />88: then he looked up to the stars.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:89" />89: He said, &lsquo;I am sick,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:90" />90: so [his people] turned away from him and left.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:91" />91: He turned to their gods and said,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:92" />92: &lsquo;Do you not eat? Why do you not speak?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:93" />93: then he turned and struck them with his right arm.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:94" />94: His people hurried towards him,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:95" />95: but he said, &lsquo;How can you worship things you carve with your own hands,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:96" />96: when it is God who has created you and all your handiwork?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:97" />97: They said, &lsquo;Build a pyre and throw him into the blazing fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:98" />98: They wanted to harm him, but We humiliated them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:99" />99: He said, &lsquo;I will go to my Lord: He is sure to guide me.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:100" />100: Lord, grant me a righteous son,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:101" />101: so We gave him the good news that he would have a patient son.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:102" />102: When the boy was old enough to work with his father, Abraham said, &lsquo;My son, I have seen myself sacrificing you in a dream. What do you think?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Father, do as you are commanded and, God willing, you will find me steadfast.&rsquo;</p>
