<p class="verse"><a name="6:19" />19: Say, &lsquo;What counts most as a witness?&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;God is witness between you and me. This Quran was revealed for me to warn you [people] and everyone it reaches. Do you really bear witness that there are other gods beside God?&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;I myself do not bear witness [to any such thing].&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;He is only one God, and I disown whatever you join with Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:20" />20: Those to whom We have given the Scripture know this as well as they know their own sons. Those who have lost their souls will not believe.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:21" />21: Who does greater wrong than someone who fabricates a lie against God or denies His revelation? Those who do such wrong will not prosper.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:22" />22: When We gather them all together and say to the polytheists, &lsquo;Where are those you claimed were partners with God?&rsquo; in their utter dismay</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:23" />23: they will only say, &lsquo;By God, our Lord, we have not set up partners beside Him!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:24" />24: See how they lie against themselves and how those they invented have deserted them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:25" />25: Among them are some who [appear to] listen to you, but we have placed covers over their hearts- so they do not understand the Quran- and deafness in their ears. Even if they saw every sign they would not believe in them. So, when they come to you, they argue with you: the disbelievers say, &lsquo;These are nothing but ancient fables,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:26" />26: and tell others not to listen [to the Quran], while they themselves keep away from it. But they ruin no one but themselves, though they fail to realize this.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:27" />27: If you could only see, when they are made to stand before the Fire, how they will say, &lsquo;If only we could be sent back, we would not reject the revelations of our Lord, but be among the believers.&rsquo;</p>
