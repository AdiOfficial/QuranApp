<p class="verse"><a name="2:182" />182: But if anyone knows that the testator has made a mistake, or done wrong, and so puts things right between the parties, he will incur no sin: God is most forgiving and merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:183" />183: You who believe, fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may be mindful of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:184" />184: Fast for a specific number of days, but if one of you is ill, or on a journey, on other days later. For those who can fast only with extreme difficulty, there is a way to compensate- feed a needy person. But if anyone does good of his own accord, it is better for him, and fasting is better for you, if only you knew.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:185" />185: It was in the month of Ramadan that the Quran was revealed as guidance for mankind, clear messages giving guidance and distinguishing between right and wrong. So any one of you who is present that month should fast, and anyone who is ill or on a journey should make up for the lost days by fasting on other days later. God wants ease for you, not hardship. He wants you to complete the prescribed period and to glorify Him for having guided you, so that you may be thankful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:186" />186: [Prophet], if My servants ask you about Me, I am near. I respond to those who call Me, so let them respond to Me, and believe in Me, so that they may be guided.</p>
