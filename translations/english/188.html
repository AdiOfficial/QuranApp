<p class="verse"><a name="9:7" />7: How could there be a treaty with God and His Messenger for such idolaters? But as for those with whom you made a treaty at the Sacred Mosque, so long as they remain true to you, be true to them; God loves those who are mindful of Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:8" />8: [How,] when, if they were to get the upper hand over you, they would not respect any tie with you, of kinship or of treaty? They please you with their tongues, but their hearts are against you and most of them are lawbreakers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:9" />9: They have sold God&rsquo;s message for a trifling gain, and barred others from His path. How evil their actions are!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:10" />10: Where believers are concerned, they respect no tie of kinship or treaty. They are the ones who are committing aggression.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:11" />11: If they turn to God, keep up the prayer, and pay the prescribed alms, then they are your brothers in faith: We make the messages clear for people who are willing to learn.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:12" />12: But if they break their oath after having made an agreement with you, if they revile your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief- oaths mean nothing to them- so that they may stop.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:13" />13: How could you not fight a people who have broken their oaths, who tried to drive the Messenger out, who attacked you first? Do you fear them? It is God you should fear if you are true believers.</p>
