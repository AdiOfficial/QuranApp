<p class="verse"><a name="26:162" />162: I am a faithful messenger to you:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:163" />163: be mindful of God and obey me.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:164" />164: I ask no reward from you, for my only reward is with the Lord of the Worlds.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:165" />165: Must you, unlike [other] people, lust after males</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="26:167" />167: but they replied, &lsquo;Lot! If you do not stop this, you will be driven away.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:168" />168: So he said, &lsquo;I loathe what you do:</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="26:171" />171: except for an old woman who stayed behind,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:172" />172: then We destroyed the others,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:173" />173: and poured a rain of destruction down upon them. How dreadful that rain was for those who had been forewarned!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:174" />174: There truly is a sign in this, though most of them will not believe:</p>
