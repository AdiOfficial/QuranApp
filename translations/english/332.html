<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="22:5" />5: People, [remember,] if you doubt the Resurrection, that We created you from dust, then a drop of fluid, then a clinging form, then a lump of flesh, both shaped and unshaped: We mean to make Our power clear to you. Whatever We choose We cause to remain in the womb for an appointed time, then We bring you forth as infants and then you grow and reach maturity.

You sometimes see the earth lifeless, yet when We send down water it stirs and swells and produces every kind of joyous growth:</p>
