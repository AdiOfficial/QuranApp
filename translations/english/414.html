<p class="verse"><a name="31:29" />29: [Prophet], do you not see that God causes the night to merge into day and the day to merge into night; that He has subjected the sun and the moon, each to run its course for a stated term; that He is aware of everything you [people] do?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:30" />30: This is because God is the Truth, and what they invoke beside Him is false. He is the Most High, Most Great.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:31" />31: [Prophet], do you not see that ships sail through the sea, by the grace of God, to show you [people] some of His wonders? Truly there are signs in this for every steadfast, thankful person.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:32" />32: When the waves loom over those on board like giant shadows they call out to God, devoting their religion entirely to Him. But, when He has delivered them safely to land, some of them waver- only a treacherous, thankless person refuses to acknowledge Our signs.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:33" />33: People, be mindful of your Lord and fear a day when no parent will take the place of their child, nor a child take the place of their parent, in any way. God&rsquo;s promise is true, so do not let the present life delude you, nor let the Deceiver delude you about God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:34" />34: Knowledge of the Hour [of Resurrection] belongs to God; it is He who sends down the relieving rain and He who knows what is hidden in the womb. No soul knows what it will reap tomorrow, and no soul knows in what land it will die; it is God who is all knowing and all aware.</p>
