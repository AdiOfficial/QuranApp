<p class="verse"><a name="10:15" />15: When Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who do not expect to meet with Us say, &lsquo;Bring [us] a different Quran, or change it.&rsquo; [Prophet], say, &lsquo;It is not for me to change it of my own accord; I only follow what is revealed to me, for I fear the torment of an awesome Day, if I were to disobey my Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:16" />16: Say, &lsquo;If God had so willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. I lived a whole lifetime among you before it came to me. How can you not use your reason?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:17" />17: Who could be more wicked than someone who invents lies against God or denies His revelations? The guilty will never prosper.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:18" />18: They worship alongside God things that can neither harm nor benefit them, and say, &lsquo;These are our intercessors with God.&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;Do you think you can tell God about something He knows not to exist in the heavens or earth? Glory be to Him! He is far above the partner-gods they associate with Him!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:19" />19: All people were originally one single community, but later they differed. If it had not been for a word from your Lord, the preordained judgement would already have been passed between them regarding their differences.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:20" />20: They say, &lsquo;Why has no miraculous sign been sent down to him from his Lord?&rsquo; Say [Prophet], &lsquo;Only God knows the unseen, so wait- I too am waiting.&rsquo;</p>
