<p class="verse"><a name="18:62" />62: They journeyed on, and then Moses said to his servant, &lsquo;Give us our lunch! This journey of ours is very tiring,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:63" />63: and [the servant] said, &lsquo;Remember when we were resting by the rock? I forgot the fish- Satan made me forget to pay attention to it- and it [must have] made its way into the sea.&rsquo; &lsquo;How strange!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:64" />64: Moses said, &lsquo;Then that was the place we were looking for.&rsquo; So the two turned back, retraced their footsteps,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:65" />65: and found one of Our servants- a man to whom We had granted Our mercy and whom We had given knowledge of Our own.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:66" />66: Moses said to him, &lsquo;May I follow you so that you can teach me some of the right guidance you have been taught?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:67" />67: The man said, &lsquo;You will not be able to bear with me patiently.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:68" />68: How could you be patient in matters beyond your knowledge?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:69" />69: Moses said, &lsquo;God willing, you will find me patient. I will not disobey you in any way.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:70" />70: The man said, &lsquo;If you follow me then, do not query anything I do before I mention it to you myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:71" />71: They travelled on. Later, when they got into a boat, and the man made a hole in it, Moses said, &lsquo;How could you make a hole in it? Do you want to drown its passengers? What a strange thing to do!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:72" />72: He replied, &lsquo;Did I not tell you that you would never be able to bear with me patiently?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:73" />73: Moses said, &lsquo;Forgive me for forgetting. Do not make it too hard for me to follow you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:74" />74: And so they travelled on. Then, when they met a young boy and the man killed him, Moses said, &lsquo;How could you kill an innocent person? He has not killed anyone! What a terrible thing to do!&rsquo;</p>
