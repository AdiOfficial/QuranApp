Say, &lsquo;God&rsquo;s guidance is the only true guidance.&rsquo; If you were to follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you would find no one to protect you from God or help you.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:121" />121: Those to whom We have given the Scripture, who follow it as it deserves, are the ones who truly believe in it. Those who deny its truth will be the losers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:122" />122: Children of Israel, remember how I blessed you and favoured you over other people,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:123" />123: and beware of a Day when no soul can stand in for another. No compensation will be accepted from it, nor intercession be of use to it, nor will anyone be helped.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:124" />124: When Abraham&rsquo;s Lord tested him with certain commandments, which he fulfilled, He said, &lsquo;I will make you a leader of people.&rsquo; Abraham asked, &lsquo;And will You make leaders from my descendants too?&rsquo; God answered, &lsquo;My pledge does not hold for those who do evil.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:125" />125: We made the House a resort and a sanctuary for people, saying, &lsquo;Take the spot where Abraham stood as your place of prayer.&rsquo; We commanded Abraham and Ishmael: &lsquo;Purify My House for those who walk round it, those who stay there, and those who bow and prostrate themselves in worship.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:126" />126: Abraham said, &lsquo;My Lord, make this land secure and provide with produce those of its people who believe in God and the Last Day.&rsquo; God said, &lsquo;As for those who disbelieve, I will grant them enjoyment for a short while and then subject them to the torment of the Fire- an evil destination.&rsquo;</p>
