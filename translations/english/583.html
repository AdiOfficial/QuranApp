<p class="verse"><a name="78:32" />32: private gardens, vineyards,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="78:33" />33: nubile, well-matched companions,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="78:34" />34: and an overflowing cup.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="78:35" />35: There they will hear no vain or lying talk:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="78:36" />36: a reward from your Lord, a fitting gift</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="78:37" />37: from the Lord of the heavens and earth and everything between, the Lord of Mercy. They will have no authority from Him to speak.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="78:38" />38: On the Day when the Spirit and the angels stand in rows, they will not speak except for those to whom the Lord of Mercy gives permission, who will say only what is right.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="78:39" />39: That is the Day of Truth. So whoever wishes to do so should take the path that leads to his Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="78:40" />40: We have warned you of imminent torment, on the Day when every person will see what their own hands have sent ahead for them, when the disbeliever will say, &lsquo;If only I were dust!&rsquo;</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="79:2" />2: raring to go,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:3" />3: sweeping ahead at full stretch,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:4" />4: overtaking swiftly</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:5" />5: to bring the matter to an end,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:6" />6: on the Day when the blast reverberates</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:7" />7: and the second blast follows,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:8" />8: hearts will tremble</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:9" />9: and eyes will be downcast.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:10" />10: They say, &lsquo;What? shall we be brought back to life,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:11" />11: after we have turned into decayed bones?&rsquo; and they say,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:12" />12: &lsquo;Such a return is impossible!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:13" />13: But all it will take is a single blast,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:14" />14: and they will be back above ground.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:15" />15: Have you [Prophet] heard the story of Moses?</p>
