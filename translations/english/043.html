<p class="verse"><a name="2:257" />257: God is the ally of those who believe: He brings them out of the depths of darkness and into the light. As for the disbelievers, their allies are false gods who take them from the light into the depths of darkness, they are the inhabitants of the Fire, and there they will remain.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:258" />258: [Prophet], have you not thought about the man who disputed with Abraham about his Lord, because God had given him power to rule? When Abraham said, &lsquo;It is my Lord who gives life and death,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I too give life and death.&rsquo; So Abraham said, &lsquo;God brings the sun from the east; so bring it from the west.&rsquo; The disbeliever was dumbfounded: God does not guide those who do evil.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:259" />259: Or take the one who passed by a ruined town. He said, &lsquo;How will God give this life when it has died?&rsquo; So God made him die for a hundred years, and then raised him up, saying, &lsquo;How long did you stay like that?&rsquo; He answered, &lsquo;A day, or part of a day.&rsquo; God said, &lsquo;No, you stayed like that for a hundred years. Look at your food and drink: they have not gone bad. Look at your donkey- We will make you a sign for the people- look at the bones: see how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh!&rsquo; When all became clear to him, he said, &lsquo;Now I know that God has power over everything.&rsquo;</p>
