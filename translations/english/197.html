<p class="verse"><a name="9:62" />62: They swear by God in order to please you [believers]: if they were true believers it would be more fitting for them to please God and His Messenger.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:63" />63: Do they not know that whoever opposes God and His Messenger will go to the Fire of Hell and stay there? That is the supreme disgrace.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:64" />64: The hypocrites fear that a sura will be revealed exposing what is in their hearts- say, &lsquo;Carry on with your jokes: God will bring about what you fear!&rsquo;-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:65" />65: yet if you were to question them, they would be sure to say, &lsquo;We were just chatting, just amusing ourselves.&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;Were you making jokes about God, His Revelations, and His Mes-senger?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:66" />66: Do not try to justify yourselves; you have gone from belief to disbelief.&rsquo; We may forgive some of you, but We will punish others: they are evildoers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:67" />67: The hypocrites, both men and women, are all the same: they order what is wrong and forbid what is right; they are tight-fisted. They have ignored God, so He has ignored them. The hypocrites are the disobedient ones.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:68" />68: God promises the Fire of Hell as a permanent home for the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers: this is enough for them. God rejects them and a lasting punishment awaits them.</p>
