<p class="verse"><a name="11:6" />6: There is not a creature that moves on earth whose provision is not His concern. He knows where it lives and its [final] resting place: it is all [there] in a clear record.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:7" />7: It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six Days&ndash;&ndash;His rule extends over the waters too&ndash;&ndash;so as to test which of you does best. Yet [Prophet], if you say to them, &lsquo;You will be resurrected after death,&rsquo; the disbelievers are sure to answer, &lsquo;This is clearly nothing but sorcery.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:8" />8: If We defer their punishment for a determined time, they are sure to say, &lsquo;What is holding it back?&rsquo; But on the Day it comes upon them, nothing will divert it from them; what they mocked will be all around them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:9" />9: How desperate and ungrateful man becomes when We let him taste Our mercy and then withhold it!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:10" />10: And if We let him taste mercy after some harm has touched him, he is sure to say, &lsquo;Misfortune has gone away from me.&rsquo; He becomes exultant and boastful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:11" />11: Not so those who are steadfast and do good deeds: they will have forgiveness and a great reward.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:12" />12: So [Prophet] are you going to abandon some part of what is revealed to you, and let your heart be oppressed by it, because they say, &lsquo;Why is no treasure sent down to him? Why has no angel come with him?&rsquo;? You are only there to warn; it is God who is in charge of everything.</p>
