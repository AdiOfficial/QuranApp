<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="64:1" />1: Everything that is in the heavens and earth glorifies God; all control and all praise belong to Him; He has power over everything.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="64:2" />2: It is He who created you, yet some of you disbelieve and some believe: God sees everything you do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="64:3" />3: He created the heavens and earth for a true purpose; He formed you and made your forms good: you will all return to Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="64:4" />4: He knows what is in the heavens and earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal; God knows very well the secrets of every heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="64:5" />5: [Disbelievers], have you not heard about those who disbelieved before you? They tasted the evil consequences of their conduct, and a painful torment awaits them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="64:6" />6: That is because their messengers came to them with clear signs, yet they said, &lsquo;Should we take guidance from mere mortals?&rsquo;, rejected the message, and turned away. But God had no need for them: He is all sufficient, worthy of all praise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="64:7" />7: The disbelievers claim they will not be raised from the dead. Say [Prophet], &lsquo;Yes indeed! I swear by my Lord! You will be raised and then you will be informed about everything you have done: an easy matter for God.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="64:8" />8: So believe in God, in His Messenger, and in the light We have sent down: God is fully aware of what you do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="64:9" />9: When He gathers you for the Day of Gathering, the Day of mutual neglect, He will cancel the sins of those who believed in Him and acted righteously: He will admit them into Gardens graced with flowing streams, there to remain for ever- the supreme triumph.</p>
