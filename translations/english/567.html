<p class="verse"><a name="69:10" />10: But when the Flood rose high,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:11" />11: We saved you in the floating ship,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:12" />12: making that event a reminder for you: attentive ears may take heed.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:13" />13: When the Trumpet is sounded a single time,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:14" />14: when the earth and its mountains are raised high and then crushed with a single blow,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:15" />15: on that Day the Great Event will come to pass.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:16" />16: The sky will be torn apart on that Day, it will be so frail.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:17" />17: The angels will be on all sides of it and, on that Day, eight of them will bear the throne of your Lord above them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:18" />18: On that Day you will be brought to judgement and none of your secrets will remain hidden.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:19" />19: Anyone who is given his Record in his right hand will say, &lsquo;Here is my Record, read it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:20" />20: I knew I would meet my Reckoning,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:21" />21: and so he will have a pleasant life</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:22" />22: in a lofty Garden,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:23" />23: with clustered fruit within his reach.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:24" />24: It will be said, &lsquo;Eat and drink to your heart&rsquo;s content as a reward for what you have done in days gone by.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:25" />25: But anyone who is given his Record in his left hand will say, &lsquo;If only I had never been given any Record</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:26" />26: and knew nothing of my Reckoning.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:27" />27: How I wish death had been the end of me.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="69:28" />28: My wealth has been no use to me,</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="69:34" />34: he never encouraged feeding the hungry,</p>
