<p class="verse"><a name="38:62" />62: They will say, &lsquo;Why do we not see those we thought were bad</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:63" />63: and took as a laughing-stock? Have our eyes missed them?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:64" />64: This is how it will really be: the inhabitants of the Fire will blame one another in this way.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:65" />65: [Prophet] say, &lsquo;I am only here to give warning. There is no god but God the One, the All Powerful,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:66" />66: Lord of the heavens and earth and everything between, the Almighty, the Most Forgiving.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:67" />67: Say, &lsquo;This message is a mighty one,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:68" />68: yet you ignore it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:69" />69: I have no knowledge of what those on high discuss:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:70" />70: it is only revealed to me that I am here to give clear warning.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:71" />71: Your Lord said to the angels, &lsquo;I will create a man from clay.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:72" />72: When I have shaped him and breathed from My Spirit into him, bow down before him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:73" />73: The angels all bowed down together,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:74" />74: but not Iblis, who was too proud. He became a rebel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:75" />75: God said, &lsquo;Iblis, what prevents you from bowing down to the man I have made with My own hands? Are you too high and mighty?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:76" />76: Iblis said, &lsquo;I am better than him: You made me from fire, and him from clay.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:77" />77: &lsquo;Get out of here! You are rejected:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:78" />78: My rejection will follow you till the Day of Judgement!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:79" />79: but Iblis said, &lsquo;My Lord, grant me respite until the Day when they are raised from the dead,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:80" />80: so He said, &lsquo;You have respite</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:81" />81: till the Appointed Day.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:82" />82: Iblis said, &lsquo;I swear by Your might! I will tempt all</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:83" />83: but Your true servants.&rsquo;</p>
