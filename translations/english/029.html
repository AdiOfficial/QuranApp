<p class="verse"><a name="2:187" />187: You [believers] are permitted to lie with your wives during the night of the fast: they are [close] as garments to you, as you are to them. God was aware that you were betraying yourselves, so He turned to you in mercy and pardoned you: now you can lie with them- seek what God has ordained for you- eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct from the black. Then fast until nightfall. Do not lie with them during the nights of your devotional retreat in the mosques: these are the bounds set by God, so do not go near them. In this way God makes His messages clear to people, that they may guard themselves against doing wrong.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:188" />188: Do not consume your property wrongfully, nor use it to bribe judges, intending sinfully and knowingly to consume parts of other people&rsquo;s property.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:189" />189: They ask you [Prophet] about crescent moons. Say, &lsquo;They show the times appointed for people, and for the pilgrimage.&rsquo; Goodness does not consist of entering houses by the back [door]; the truly good person is the one who is mindful of God. So enter your houses by their [main] doors and be mindful of God so that you may prosper.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:190" />190: Fight in God&rsquo;s cause against those who fight you, but do not overstep the limits: God does not love those who overstep the limits.</p>
