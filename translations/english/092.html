<p class="verse"><a name="4:87" />87: He is God: there is no god but Him. He will gather you all together on the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. Whose word can be truer than God&rsquo;s?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:88" />88: [Believers], why are you divided in two about the hypocrites, when God Himself has rejected them because of what they have done? Do you want to guide those God has left to stray? If God leaves anyone to stray, you [Prophet] will never find the way for him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:89" />89: They would dearly like you to reject faith, as they themselves have done, to be like them. So do not take them as allies until they migrate [to Medina] for God&rsquo;s cause. If they turn [on you], then seize and kill them wherever you encounter them. Take none of them as an ally or supporter.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:90" />90: But as for those who seek refuge with people with whom you have a treaty, or who come over to you because their hearts shrink from fighting against you or against their own people, God could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. So if they withdraw and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then God gives you no way against them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:91" />91: You will find others who wish to be safe from you, and from their own people, but whenever they are back in a situation where they are tempted [to fight you], they succumb to it. So if they neither withdraw, nor offer you peace, nor restrain themselves from fighting you, seize and kill them wherever you encounter them: We give you clear authority against such people.</p>
