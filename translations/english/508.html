<p class="verse"><a name="47:12" />12: God will admit those who believe and do good deeds to Gardens graced with flowing streams; the disbelievers may take their fill of pleasure in this world, and eat as cattle do, but the Fire will be their home.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="47:13" />13: We have destroyed many a town stronger than your own [Prophet]- the town which [chose to] expel you- and they had no one to help them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="47:14" />14: Can those who follow clear proof from their Lord be compared to those whose foul deeds are made to seem alluring to them, those who follow their own desires?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="47:15" />15: Here is a picture of the Garden promised to the pious: rivers of water forever pure, rivers of milk forever fresh, rivers of wine, a delight for those who drink, rivers of honey clarified and pure, [all] flow in it; there they will find fruit of every kind; and they will find forgiveness from their Lord. How can this be compared to the fate of those stuck in the Fire, given boiling water to drink that tears their bowels?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="47:16" />16: Some of these people listen to you [Prophet], but, once they leave your presence, they sneer at those who have been given knowledge, saying, &lsquo;What was that he just said?&rsquo; These are the ones whose hearts God has sealed, those who follow their own desires.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="47:17" />17: God has increased the guidance of those who follow the right path, and given them their awareness [of Him].</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="47:18" />18: What are the disbelievers waiting for, other than the Hour which will come upon them unawares? Its signs are already here, but once the Hour has actually arrived, what use will it be then to take heed?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="47:19" />19: So [Prophet], bear in mind that there is no god but God, and ask forgiveness for your sins and for the sins of believing men and women. God knows whenever any of you move, and whenever any of you stay still.</p>
