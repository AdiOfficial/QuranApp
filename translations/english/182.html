<p class="verse"><a name="8:41" />41: Know that one-fifth of your battle gains belongs to God and the Messenger, to close relatives and orphans, to the needy and travellers, if you believe in God and the revelation We sent down to Our servant on the day of the decision, the day when the two forces met in battle. God has power over all things.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:42" />42: Remember when you were on the near side of the valley, and they were on the far side and the caravan was below you. If you had made an appointment to fight, you would have failed to keep it [but the battle took place] so that God might bring about something already ordained, so that those who were to die might die after seeing a clear proof, and so that those who were to live might live after seeing a clear proof- God is all hearing and all seeing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:43" />43: [Prophet], remember when God made you see them in your sleep as few: if He had shown them to you [believers] as many, you would certainly have lost heart and argued about it, but God saved you. He knows the secrets of the heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:44" />44: When you met He showed them to you as few, and He made you few in their eyes, so that He might bring about what has been ordained: everything goes back to God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:45" />45: Believers, when you meet a force in battle, stand firm and keep God firmly in mind, so that you may prosper.</p>
