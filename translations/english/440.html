<p class="verse"><a name="35:45" />45: If God were to punish people [at once] for the wrong they have done, there would not be a single creature left on the surface of the earth. He gives them respite for a stated time and, whenever their time comes, God has been watching His servants.</p>
<p class="surah">Ya Seen</p>
<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:1" />1: Ya Sin</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:2" />2: By the wise Quran,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:3" />3: you [Muhammad] are truly one of the mes-sengers sent</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:4" />4: on a straight path,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:5" />5: with a revelation from the Almighty, the Lord of Mercy,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:6" />6: to warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, and so they are unaware.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:7" />7: The verdict has been passed against most of them, for they refuse to believe.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:8" />8: [It is as if] We had placed [iron] collars around their necks, right up to their chins so that their heads are forced up</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:9" />9: and set barriers before and behind them, blocking their vision: they cannot see.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:10" />10: It is all the same to them whether you warn them or not: they will not believe.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:11" />11: You can warn only those who will follow the Quran and hold the Merciful One in awe, though they cannot see Him: give such people the glad news of forgiveness and a noble reward.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:12" />12: We shall certainly bring the dead back to life, and We record what they send ahead of them as well as what they leave behind: We keep an account of everything in a clear Record.</p>
