<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:1" />1: By those [angels] ranged in rows,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:2" />2: who rebuke reproachfully</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:3" />3: and recite God&rsquo;s word,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:4" />4: truly your God is One,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:5" />5: Lord of the heavens and earth and everything between them, Lord of every sunrise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:6" />6: We have adorned the lowest heaven with stars,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:7" />7: and made them a safeguard against every rebellious devil:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:8" />8: they cannot eavesdrop on the Higher Assembly&ndash;&ndash;pelted from every side,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:9" />9: driven away, they will have perpetual torment&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:10" />10: if any [of them] stealthily snatches away a fragment, he will be pursued by a piercing flame.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:11" />11: So [Prophet], ask the disbelievers: is it harder to create them than other beings We have created? We created them from sticky clay.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:12" />12: You marvel as they scoff,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:13" />13: take no heed when they are warned,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:14" />14: and resort to ridicule when they see a sign,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:15" />15: saying, &lsquo;This is no more than blatant sorcery.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:16" />16: &lsquo;What! After we have died and become dust and bones, shall we really be raised up again,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:17" />17: along with our forefathers?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:18" />18: Say, &lsquo;Yes indeed, and you will be humiliated.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:19" />19: Just one blast and&ndash;&ndash;lo and behold!&ndash;&ndash;they will look</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:20" />20: and say, &lsquo;Woe to us! This is the Day of Judgement.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:21" />21: [It will be said], &lsquo;This is the Day of Decision, which you used to deny.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:22" />22: [Angels], gather together those who did wrong, and others like them, as well as whatever they worshipped</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:23" />23: beside God, lead them all to the path of Hell,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:24" />24: and halt them for questioning:</p>
