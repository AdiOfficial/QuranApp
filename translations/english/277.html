<p class="verse"><a name="16:88" />88: Because of the corruption they spread, We shall add torment upon torment for those who disbelieved and barred others from the path of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:89" />89: The day will come when We raise up in each community a witness against them, and We shall bring you [Prophet] as a witness against these people, for We have sent the Scripture down to you explaining everything, and as guidance and mercy and good news to those who devote themselves to God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:90" />90: God commands justice, doing good, and generosity towards relatives and He forbids what is shameful, blameworthy, and oppressive. He teaches you, so that you may take heed.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:91" />91: Fulfil any pledge you make in God&rsquo;s name and do not break oaths after you have sworn them, for you have made God your surety: God knows everything you do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:92" />92: Do not use your oaths to deceive each other- like a woman who unravels the thread she has firmly spun- just because one party may be more numerous than another. God tests you with this, and on the Day of the Resurrection He will make clear to you those things you differed about.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:93" />93: If God so willed, He would have made you all one people, but He leaves to stray whoever He will and guides whoever He will. You will be questioned about your deeds.</p>
