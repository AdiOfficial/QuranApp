<p class="verse"><a name="6:152" />152: Stay well away from the property of orphans, except with the best [intentions], until they come of age; give full measure and weight, according to justice&rsquo;- We do not burden any soul with more than it can bear- &lsquo; when you speak, be just, even if it concerns a relative; keep any promises you make in God&rsquo;s name. This is what He commands you to do, so that you may take heed&rsquo;-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:153" />153: this is My path, leading straight, so follow it, and do not follow other ways: they will lead you away from it- &lsquo; This is what He commands you to do, so that you may refrain from wrongdoing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:154" />154: Once again, We gave Moses the Scripture, perfecting [Our favour] for those who do good, explaining everything clearly, as guidance and mercy, so that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:155" />155: This, too, is a blessed Scripture which We have sent down- follow it and be conscious of your Lord, so that you may receive mercy-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:156" />156: lest you say, &lsquo;Scriptures were only sent down to two communities before us: we were not aware of what they studied,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:157" />157: or &lsquo;If only the Scripture had been sent down to us, we would have been better guided than them.&rsquo; Now clear evidence, guidance, and mercy have come to you from your Lord. Who could be more wrong than someone who rejects God&rsquo;s revelations and turns away from them? We shall repay those who turn away with a painful punishment.</p>
