<p class="verse"><a name="32:13" />13: &lsquo;If it had been Our will, We could certainly have given every soul its true guidance, but My words have come true. &ldquo;I shall be sure to fill Hell with jinn and men together.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="32:15" />15: The only people who truly believe in Our messages are those who, when they are reminded of them, bow down in worship, cele-brate their Lord&rsquo;s praises, and do not think themselves above this.</p>
