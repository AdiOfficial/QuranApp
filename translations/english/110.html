<p class="verse"><a name="5:14" />14: We also took a pledge from those who say, &lsquo;We are Christians,&rsquo; but they too forgot some of what they were told to remember, so We stirred up enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection, when God will tell them what they have done.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:15" />15: People of the Book, Our Messenger has come to make clear to you much of what you have kept hidden of the Scripture, and to overlook much [you have done]. A light has now come to you from God, and a Scripture making things clear,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:16" />16: with which God guides to the ways of peace those who follow what pleases Him, bringing them from darkness out into light, by His will, and guiding them to a straight path.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:17" />17: Those who say, &lsquo;God is the Messiah, the son of Mary,&rsquo; are defying the truth. Say, &lsquo;If it had been God&rsquo;s will, could anyone have prevented Him from destroying the Messiah, son of Mary, together with his mother and everyone else on earth? Control of the heavens and earth and all that is between them belongs to God: He creates whatever He will. God has power over everything.&rsquo;</p>
