<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="32:1" />1: Alif Lam Mim</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="32:2" />2: This scripture, free from all doubt, has been sent down from the Lord of the Worlds.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="32:3" />3: Yet they say, &lsquo;Muhammad has made it up.&rsquo; No indeed! It is the Truth from your Lord for you [Prophet], to warn a people who have had no one to warn them before, so that they may be guided.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="32:4" />4: It is God who created the heavens and the earth and everything between them in six Days. Then He established Himself on the Throne. You [people] have no one but Him to protect you and no one to intercede for you, so why do you not take heed?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="32:5" />5: He runs everything, from the heavens to the earth, and everything will ascend to Him in the end, on a Day that will measure a thousand years in your reckoning.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="32:6" />6: Such is He who knows all that is unseen as well as what is seen, the Almighty, the Merciful,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="32:7" />7: who gave everything its perfect form. He first created man from clay,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="32:8" />8: then made his descendants from an extract of underrated fluid.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="32:9" />9: Then He moulded him; He breathed from His Spirit into him; He gave you hearing, sight, and minds. How seldom you are grateful!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="32:10" />10: They say, &lsquo;What? When we have disappeared into the earth, shall we really be created anew?&rsquo; In fact, they deny the meeting with their Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="32:11" />11: Say, &lsquo;The Angel of Death put in charge of you will reclaim you, and then you will be brought back to your Lord.&rsquo;</p>
