<p class="verse"><a name="85:1" />1: By the sky with its towering constellations,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="85:2" />2: by the promised Day,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="85:3" />3: by the Witness and that which is witnessed,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="85:4" />4: damned were the makers of the trench,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="85:5" />5: the makers of the fuel-stoked fire!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="85:6" />6: They sat down</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="85:7" />7: to watch what they were doing to the believers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="85:8" />8: Their only grievance against them was their faith in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="85:9" />9: to whom all control over the heavens and earth belongs: God is witness over all things.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="85:10" />10: For those who persecute believing men and women, and do not repent afterwards, there will be the torment of Hell and burning.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="85:11" />11: But for those who believe and do good deeds there will be Gardens graced with flowing streams: that is the great triumph.</p>
