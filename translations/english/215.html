<p class="verse"><a name="10:54" />54: Every soul that has done evil, if it possessed all that is on the earth, would gladly offer it as ransom. When they see the punishment, they will repent in secret, but they will be judged with justice and will not be wronged.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:55" />55: It is to God that everything in the heavens and the earth truly belongs: God&rsquo;s promise is true, but most people do not realize it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:56" />56: It is He who gives life and takes it, and you will all be returned to Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:57" />57: People, a teaching from your Lord has come to you, a healing for what is in [your] hearts, and guidance and mercy for the believers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:58" />58: Say [Prophet], &lsquo;In God&rsquo;s grace and mercy let them rejoice: these are better than all they accumulate.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:59" />59: Say, &lsquo;Think about the provision God has sent down for you, some of which you have made unlawful and some lawful.&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;Has God given you permission [to do this], or are you inventing lies about God?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:60" />60: What will those people who invent lies about Him think on the Day of Resurrection? God is bountiful towards people, but most of them do not give thanks.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:61" />61: In whatever matter you [Prophet] may be engaged and whatever part of the Quran you are reciting, whatever work you [people] are doing, We witness you when you are engaged in it. Not even the weight of a speck of dust in the earth or sky escapes your Lord, nor anything lesser or greater: it is all written in a clear record.</p>
