<p class="verse"><a name="5:104" />104: when it is said to them, &lsquo;Come to what God has sent down, and to the Messenger,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;What we inherited from our forefathers is good enough for us,&rsquo; even though their forefathers knew nothing and were not guided.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:105" />105: You who believe, you are responsible for your own souls; if anyone else goes astray it will not harm you so long as you follow the guidance; you will all return to God, and He will make you realize what you have done.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:106" />106: You who believe, when death approaches any of you, let two just men from among you act as witnesses to the making of a bequest, or two men from another people if you are journeying in the land when death approaches. Keep the two witnesses back after prayer, if you have any doubts, and make them both swear by God, &lsquo;We will not sell our testimony for any price, even if a close relative is involved. We will not hide God&rsquo;s testimony, for then we should be doing wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:107" />107: If it is discovered that these two are guilty [of perjury], two of those whose rights have been usurped have a better right to bear witness in their place. Let them swear by God, &lsquo;Our testimony is truer than theirs. We have said nothing but the truth, for that would make us wrongdoers&rsquo;:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:108" />108: that will make it more likely they will give true and proper testimony, or fear that their oaths might be refuted by others afterwards. Be mindful of God and listen; God does not guide those who break His laws.</p>
