<p class="verse"><a name="26:184" />184: Be mindful of God who created you and former generations,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:185" />185: but they replied, &lsquo;You are bewitched!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:186" />186: You are nothing but a man like us. In fact we think you are a liar.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:187" />187: Make bits of the heavens fall down on us, if you are telling the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:188" />188: He said, &lsquo;My Lord knows best what you do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:189" />189: They called him a liar, and so the torment of the Day of Shadow came upon them- it was the torment of a terrible day.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:190" />190: There truly is a sign in this, though most of them will not believe:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:191" />191: your Lord alone is the Almighty, the Merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:192" />192: Truly, this Quran has been sent down by the Lord of the Worlds:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:193" />193: the Trustworthy Spirit brought it down</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:194" />194: to your heart [Prophet], so that you could bring warning</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:195" />195: in a clear Arabic tongue.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:196" />196: This was foretold in the scriptures of earlier religions.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:197" />197: Is it not proof enough for them that the learned men of the Children of Israel have recognized it?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:198" />198: If We had sent it down to someone who was not an Arab,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:199" />199: and he had recited it to them, they still would not have believed in it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:200" />200: So We make it pass straight through the hearts of the guilty:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:201" />201: they will not believe in it until they see the grievous torment,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:202" />202: which will suddenly hit them when they are not expecting it,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:203" />203: and then they will say, &lsquo;Can we have more time?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:204" />204: How can they ask that Our punishment be brought to them sooner?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:205" />205: Think, if we let them enjoy this life for some years</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:206" />206: and then the promised torment came upon them,</p>
