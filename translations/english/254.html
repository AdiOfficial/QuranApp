<p class="verse"><a name="13:41" />41: Do they not see how We come to [their] land and shrink its borders? God decides- no one can reverse His decision- and He is swift in reckoning.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:42" />42: Those before them also schemed, but the overall scheme belongs to God: He knows what each soul does. In the end, the disbelievers will find out who will have the excellent home.</p>
