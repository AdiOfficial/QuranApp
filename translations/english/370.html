<p class="verse"><a name="26:61" />61: and as soon as the two sides came within sight of one another, Moses&rsquo; followers said, &lsquo;We shall definitely be caught.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:62" />62: Moses said, &lsquo;No, my Lord is with me: He will guide me,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:63" />63: and We revealed to Moses: &lsquo;Strike the sea with your staff.&rsquo; It parted- each side like a mighty mountain-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:64" />64: and We brought the others to that place:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:65" />65: We saved Moses and all his companions,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:66" />66: and drowned the rest.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:67" />67: There truly is a sign in this, though most of them do not believe:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:68" />68: your Lord alone is the Almighty, the Merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:69" />69: Tell them the story of Abraham,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:70" />70: when he asked his father and his people, &lsquo;What do you worship?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:71" />71: They said, &lsquo;We worship idols, and are constantly in attendance on them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:72" />72: He asked, &lsquo;Do they hear you when you call?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:73" />73: Do they help or harm you?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:74" />74: They replied, &lsquo;No, but this is what we saw our fathers doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:75" />75: Abraham said, &lsquo;Those idols you have worshipped,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:76" />76: you and your forefathers,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:77" />77: are my enemies; not so the Lord of the Worlds,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:78" />78: who created me. It is He who guides me;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:79" />79: He who gives me food and drink;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:80" />80: He who cures me when I am ill;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:81" />81: He who will make me die and then give me life again;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:82" />82: and He who will, I hope, forgive my faults on the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:83" />83: My Lord, grant me wisdom; join me with the righteous;</p>
