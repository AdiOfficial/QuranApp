<p class="verse"><a name="16:27" />27: In the end, on the Day of Resurrection, He will shame them, saying, &lsquo;Where are these &ldquo;partners&rdquo; of Mine on whose account you opposed [Me]?&rsquo; Those given knowledge will say, &lsquo;Shame and misery on the disbelievers today!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:28" />28: Those whose lives the angels take while they are wronging themselves will show submission: &lsquo;We were doing no evil.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes you were: God knows fully everything that you have done,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:29" />29: so enter the gates of Hell. There you will remain- the home of the arrogant is evil indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:30" />30: But when the righteous are asked, &lsquo;What has your Lord sent down?&rsquo; they will say, &lsquo;All that is good.&rsquo; There is a reward in this present world for those who do good, but their home in the Hereafter is far better: the home of the righteous is excellent.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:31" />31: They will enter perpetual Gardens graced with flowing streams. There they will have everything they wish. This is the way God rewards the righteous,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:32" />32: those whose lives the angels take in a state of goodness. They will say to them, &lsquo;Peace be upon you. Enter the Garden as a reward for what you have done.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:33" />33: Are the disbelievers waiting for the angels to come to them, or your Lord&rsquo;s Judgement? Those who went before them did the same. God did not wrong them; they wronged themselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="16:34" />34: So the evil they had done hit them and they were surrounded by the very thing they had mocked.</p>
