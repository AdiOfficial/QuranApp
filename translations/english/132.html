<p class="verse"><a name="6:36" />36: Only those who can hear will respond; as for the dead, God will raise them up, and to Him they will all be returned.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:37" />37: They also say, &lsquo;Why has no sign been sent down to him from his Lord?&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;God certainly has the power to send down a sign,&rsquo; though most of them do not know:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:38" />38: all the creatures that crawl on the earth and those that fly with their wings are communities like yourselves. We have missed nothing out of the Record- in the end they will be gathered to their Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:39" />39: Those who reject Our signs are deaf, dumb, and in total darkness. God leaves whoever He will to stray, and sets whoever He will on a straight path.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:40" />40: Say, &lsquo;Think: if the punishment of God or the Hour should come to you, would you call on anyone other than God, if you are being truthful?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:41" />41: No indeed, it is on Him that you would call. If it were His will, He could remove whatever harm made you call on Him, and then you would forget what you now associate with Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:42" />42: We sent messengers before you [Prophet] to many communities and afflicted their people with suffering and hardships, so that they could learn humility.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:43" />43: If only they had learned humility when suffering came from Us! But no, their hearts became hard and Satan made their foul deeds alluring to them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:44" />44: So, when they had forgotten the warning they had received, We opened the gates to everything for them. Then, as they revelled in what they had been given, We struck them suddenly and they were dumbfounded.</p>
