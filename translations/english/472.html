<p class="verse"><a name="40:41" />41: My people, why do I call you to salvation when you call me to the Fire?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:42" />42: You call me to disbelieve in God and to associate with Him things of which I have no knowledge; I call you to the Mighty, the Forgiving One.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:43" />43: There is no doubt that what you call me to serve is not fit to be invoked either in this world or the Hereafter: our return is to God alone, and it will be the rebels who will inhabit the Fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:44" />44: [One Day] you will remember what I am saying to you now, so I commit my case to God: God is well aware of His servants.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:45" />45: So God saved him from the harm they planned. A terrible punishment engulfed Pharaoh&rsquo;s people;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:46" />46: they will be brought before the Fire morning and evening. On the Day the Hour comes, it will be said, &lsquo;Throw Pharaoh&rsquo;s people into the worst torment.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:47" />47: In the Fire they will quarrel with one another: the weak will say to the haughty, &lsquo;We were your followers, so can you now relieve us from some share of the Fire?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:48" />48: but they will say, &lsquo;We are all in this together. God has judged between His creatures.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:49" />49: Those in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell, &lsquo;Ask your Lord to lessen our suffering for one day,&rsquo;</p>
