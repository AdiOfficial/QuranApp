<p class="verse"><a name="77:20" />20: Did We not make you from an underrated fluid</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:21" />21: which We housed in a safe lodging</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:22" />22: for a determined period?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:23" />23: We determine [it]: how excellently We determine!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:24" />24: Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:25" />25: Did We not make the earth a home</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:26" />26: for the living and the dead?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:27" />27: Did We not place firm, lofty mountains on it and provide you with sweet water?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:28" />28: Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:29" />29: They will be told, &lsquo;Go to that which you used to deny!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:30" />30: Go to a shadow of smoke!&rsquo; It rises in three columns;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:31" />31: no shade does it give, nor relief from the flame;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:32" />32: it shoots out sparks as large as treetrunks</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:33" />33: and as bright as copper.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:34" />34: Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:35" />35: On that Day they will be speechless,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:36" />36: and they will be given no chance to offer any excuses.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:37" />37: Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:38" />38: [They will be told], &lsquo;This is the Day of Decision: We have gathered you and earlier generations.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:39" />39: If you have any plots against Me, try them now.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:40" />40: Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:41" />41: But those who took heed of God will enjoy cool shade, springs,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:42" />42: and any fruit they desire;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:43" />43: [they will be told], &lsquo;Eat and drink to your hearts&rsquo; content as a reward for your deeds:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:44" />44: this is how We reward those who do good.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:45" />45: Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:46" />46: [You may] eat and enjoy yourselves for a short while, evildoers that you are.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:47" />47: Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:48" />48: When they are told, &lsquo;Bow down in prayer,&rsquo; they do not do so.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:49" />49: Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="77:50" />50: In what revelation, after this, will they believe?</p>
