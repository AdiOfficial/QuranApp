<p class="verse"><a name="6:60" />60: It is He who calls your souls back by night, knowing what you have done by day, then raises you up again in the daytime until your fixed term is fulfilled. It is to Him that you will return in the end, and He will tell you what you have done.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:61" />61: He is the Supreme Master over His subjects. He sends out recorders to watch over you until, when death overtakes any of you, those sent by Us take his soul- they never fail in their duty.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:62" />62: Then they will all be returned to God, their true Lord. The Judgement truly belongs to Him, and He is the swiftest of reckoners.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:63" />63: Say [Prophet], &lsquo;Who is it that saves you from the dark depths of land and sea when you humbly and secretly call to Him [and say], &ldquo;If He rescues us from this, We shall truly be thankful&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:64" />64: Say, &lsquo;God rescues you from this and every distress; yet still you worship others beside Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:65" />65: Say, &lsquo;He has power to send punishment on you from above or from under your very feet, or to divide you into discordant factions and make some taste the violence of others.&rsquo; See how We explain Our revelation in various ways, so that they may understand,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:66" />66: yet your people still reject it even though it is the truth. Say, &lsquo;I have not been put in charge of you.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:67" />67: Every prophecy has its fixed time to be fulfilled: you will come to realize this.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:68" />68: When you come across people who speak with scorn about Our revelations, turn away from them until they move on to another topic. If Satan should make you forget, then, when you have remembered, do not sit with those who are doing wrong.</p>
