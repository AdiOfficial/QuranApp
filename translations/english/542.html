<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="58:1" />1: God has heard the words of the woman who disputed with you [Prophet] about her husband and complained to God: God has heard what you both had to say. He is all hearing, all seeing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="58:2" />2: Even if any of you say to their wives, &lsquo;You are to me like my mother&rsquo;s back,&rsquo;they are not their mothers; their only mothers are those who gave birth to them. What they say is certainly blameworthy and false, but God is pardoning and forgiving.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="58:3" />3: Those of you who say such a thing to their wives, then go back on what they have said, must free a slave before the couple may touch one another again&ndash;&ndash;this is what you are commanded to do, and God is fully aware of what you do&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="58:4" />4: but anyone who does not have the means should fast continuously for two months before they touch each other, and anyone unable to do this should feed sixty needy people. This is so that you may [truly] have faith in God and His Messenger. These are the bounds set by God: grievous torment awaits those who ignore them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="58:5" />5: Those who oppose God and His Messenger will be brought low, like those before them: We have revealed clear messages, and humiliating torment awaits those who ignore them,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="58:6" />6: on the Day when God will raise everyone and make them aware of what they have done. God has taken account of it all, though they may have forgotten: He witnesses everything.</p>
