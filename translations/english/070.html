<p class="verse"><a name="3:154" />154: After sorrow, He caused calm to descend upon you, a sleep that overtook some of you. Another group, caring only for themselves, entertained false thoughts about God, thoughts more appropriate to pagan ignorance, and said, &lsquo;Do we get a say in any of this?&rsquo; [Prophet], tell them, &lsquo;Everything to do with this affair is in God&rsquo;s hands.&rsquo; They conceal in their hearts things they will not reveal to you. They say, &lsquo;If we had had our say in this, none of us would have been killed here.&rsquo; Tell them, &lsquo;Even if you had resolved to stay at home, those who were destined to be killed would still have gone out to meet their deaths.&rsquo; God did this in order to test everything within you and in order to prove what is in your hearts. God knows your innermost thoughts very well.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:155" />155: As for those of you who turned away on the day the two armies met in battle, it was Satan who caused them to slip, through some of their actions. God has now pardoned them: God is most forgiving and forbearing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:156" />156: You who believe, do not be like those who disbelieved and said of their brothers who went out on a journey or a raid, &lsquo;If only they had stayed with us they would not have died or been killed,&rsquo; for God will make such thoughts a source of anguish in their hearts. It is God who gives life and death; God sees everything you do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:157" />157: Whether you are killed for God&rsquo;s cause or die, God&rsquo;s forgiveness and mercy are better than anything people amass.</p>
