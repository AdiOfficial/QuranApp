<p class="verse"><a name="24:62" />62: The true believers are those who believe in God and His Mes-senger, who, when they are gathered with him on a communal matter, do not depart until they have asked his permission- those who ask your permission [Prophet] are the ones who truly believe in God and His Messenger. When they ask your permission to attend to their private affairs, allow whoever you see fit and ask God to forgive them. God is most forgiving and merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:63" />63: [People], do not regard the Messenger&rsquo;s summons to you like one of you summoning another- God is well aware of those of you who steal away surreptitiously- and those who go against his order should beware lest a trial afflict them or they receive a painful punishment.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:64" />64: Everything in the heavens and earth belongs to God: He knows what state you are in- on the Day when all are returned to Him, He will tell them everything they have done- God has full knowledge of everything.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="25:1" />1: Exalted is He who has sent the Differentiator down to His servant so that it may be a warning to all people.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="25:2" />2: It is He who has control over the heavens and earth and has no offspring&ndash;&ndash;no one shares control with Him&ndash;&ndash;and who created all things and made them to an exact measure.</p>
