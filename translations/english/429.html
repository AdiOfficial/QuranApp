<p class="verse"><a name="34:8" />8: Has he invented a lie about God? Is he mad?&rsquo; No! It is those who do not believe in the life to come who will suffer torment, for they are in gross error.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:9" />9: Do they not think about what is in front of them and behind them in the heavens and earth? If We wished, We could make the earth swallow them, or make fragments from the heavens fall down upon them. There truly is a sign in this for every servant who turns back to God in repentance.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:10" />10: We graced David with Our favour. We said, &lsquo;You mountains, echo God&rsquo;s praises together with him, and you birds, too.&rsquo; We softened iron for him,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:11" />11: saying, &lsquo;Make coats of chain mail and measure the links well.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do good, all of you, for I see everything you do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:12" />12: And [We subjected] the wind for Solomon. Its outward journey took a month, and its return journey likewise. We made a fountain of molten brass flow for him, and some of the jinn worked under his control with his Lord&rsquo;s permission. If one of them deviated from Our command, We let him taste the suffering of the blazing flame.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:13" />13: They made him whatever he wanted- palaces, statues, basins as large as water troughs, fixed cauldrons. We said, &lsquo;Work thankfully, family of David, for few of my servants are truly thankful.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:14" />14: Then, when We decreed Solomon&rsquo;s death, nothing showed the jinn he was dead, but a creature of the earth eating at his stick: when he fell down they realized- if they had known what was hidden they would not have continued their demeaning labour.</p>
