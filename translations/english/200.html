<p class="verse"><a name="9:80" />80: It makes no difference [Prophet] whether you ask forgiveness for them or not: God will not forgive them even if you ask seventy times, because they reject God and His Messenger. God does not guide those who rebel against Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:81" />81: Those who were left behind were happy to stay behind when God&rsquo;s Messenger set out; they hated the thought of striving in God&rsquo;s way with their possessions and their persons. They said to one another, &lsquo;Do not go [to war] in this heat.&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;Hellfire is hotter.&rsquo; If only they understood!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:82" />82: Let them laugh a little; they will weep a lot in return for what they have done.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:83" />83: So [Prophet], if God brings you back to a group of them, who ask you for permission to go out [to battle], say, &lsquo;You will never go out and fight an enemy with me: you chose to sit at home the first time, so remain with those who stay behind now.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:84" />84: Do not hold prayers for any of them if they die, and do not stand by their graves: they disbelieved in God and His Messenger and died rebellious.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:85" />85: Do not let their possessions and their children impress you: God means to punish them through these in this world, and that their souls should depart while they disbelieve.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:86" />86: When a sura is revealed [saying], &lsquo;Believe in God and strive hard alongside His Messenger,&rsquo; their wealthy ask your permission [to be exempt], saying, &lsquo;Allow us to stay behind with the others&rsquo;:</p>
