<p class="verse"><a name="42:11" />11: the Creator of the heavens and earth.&rsquo; He made mates for you from among yourselves&ndash;&ndash;and for the animals too&ndash;&ndash;so that you may multiply. There is nothing like Him: He is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="42:12" />12: The keys of the heavens and the earth are His; He provides abundantly or sparingly for whoever He will; He has full knowledge of all things.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="42:13" />13: In matters of faith, He has laid down for you [people] the same commandment that He gave Noah, which We have revealed to you [Muhammad] and which We enjoined on Abraham and Moses and Jesus: &lsquo;Uphold the faith and do not divide into factions within it&rsquo;- what you [Prophet] call upon the idolaters to do is hard for them; God chooses whoever He pleases for Himself and guides towards Himself those who turn to Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="42:14" />14: They divided, out of rivalry, only after knowledge had come to them, and, if it had not been for a decree already passed by your Lord to reprieve them until an appointed time, they would already have been judged. Those after them, who inherited the Scripture, are in disquieting doubt about it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="42:15" />15: So [Prophet] call people to that faith and follow the straight path as you have been commanded. Do not go by what they desire, but say, &lsquo;I believe in whatever Scripture God has sent down. I am commanded to bring justice between you. God is our Lord and your Lord- to us our deeds and to you yours, so let there be no argument between us and you- God will gather us together, and to Him we shall return.&rsquo;</p>
