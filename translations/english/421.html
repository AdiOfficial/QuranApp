<p class="verse"><a name="33:23" />23: There are men among the believers who honoured their pledge to God: some of them have fulfilled it by death, and some are still waiting. They have not changed in the least.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:24" />24: [Such trials are ordained] so that God may reward the truthful for their honesty and punish the hypocrites, if He so wills, or He may relent towards them, for God is forgiving and merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:25" />25: God sent back the disbelievers along with their rage- they gained no benefit&ndash;&ndash; and spared the believers from fighting. He is strong and mighty.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:26" />26: He brought those People of the Book who supported them down from their strongholds and put panic into their hearts. Some of them you [believers] killed and some you took captive.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:27" />27: He passed on to you their land, their houses, their possessions, and a land where you had not set foot: God has power over everything.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:28" />28: Prophet, say to your wives,&lsquo;If your desire is for the present life and its finery, then come, I will make provision for you and release you with kindness,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:29" />29: but if you desire God, His Messenger, and the Final Home, then remember that God has prepared great rewards for those of you who do good.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:30" />30: Wives of the Prophet, if any of you does something clearly outrageous, she will be doubly punished- that is easy for God-</p>
