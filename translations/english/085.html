<p class="verse"><a name="4:38" />38: [Nor does He like those] who spend their wealth to show off, who do not believe in Him or the Last Day. Whoever has Satan as his companion has an evil companion!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:39" />39: What harm would it do them to believe in God and the Last Day, and give charitably from the sustenance God has given them? God knows them well.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:40" />40: He does not wrong anyone by as much as the weight of a speck of dust: He doubles any good deed and gives a tremendous reward of His own.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:41" />41: What will they do when We bring a witness from each community, with you [Muhammad] as a witness against these people?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:42" />42: On that day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Prophet will wish that the earth could swallow them up: they will not be able to hide anything from God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:43" />43: You who believe, do not come anywhere near the prayer if you are intoxicated, not until you know what you are saying; nor if you are in a state of major ritual impurity- though you may pass through the mosque- not until you have bathed; if you are ill, on a journey, have relieved yourselves, or had intercourse, and cannot find any water, then find some clean sand and wipe your faces and hands with it. God is always ready to pardon and forgive.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:44" />44: [Prophet], have you not considered how those who were given a share of the Scripture purchase misguidance and want you [believers], too, to lose the right path?</p>
