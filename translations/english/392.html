<p class="verse"><a name="28:51" />51: We have caused Our Word to come to them so that they may be mindful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:52" />52: Those to whom We gave the Scripture before believe in it,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:53" />53: and, when it is recited to them, say, &lsquo;We believe in it, it is the truth from our Lord. Before it came we had already devoted ourselves to Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:54" />54: They will be given their rewards twice over because they are steadfast, repel evil with good, give to others out of what We have provided for them,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:55" />55: and turn away whenever they hear frivolous talk, saying, &lsquo;We have our deeds and you have yours. Peace be with you! We do not seek the company of ignorant people.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:56" />56: You [Prophet] cannot guide everyone you love to the truth; it is God who guides whoever He will: He knows best those who will follow guidance.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:57" />57: They say, &lsquo;If we were to follow guidance with you [Prophet], we would be swept from our land.&rsquo; Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary where every kind of produce is brought, as a provision from Us? But most of them do not comprehend.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:58" />58: We have destroyed many a community that once revelled in its wanton wealth and easy living: since then their dwelling places have barely been inhabited- We are the only heir.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:59" />59: Your Lord would never destroy towns without first raising a messenger in their midst to recite Our messages to them, nor would We destroy towns unless their inhabitants were evildoers.</p>
