<p class="verse"><a name="36:41" />41: Another sign for them is that We carried their seed in the laden Ark,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:42" />42: and We have made similar things for them to ride in.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:43" />43: If We wished, We could drown them, and there would be no one to help them: they could not be saved.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:44" />44: Only by Our mercy could they be reprieved to enjoy life for a while.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:45" />45: Yet when they are told, &lsquo;Beware of what lies before and behind you, so that you may be given mercy,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:46" />46: they ignore every single sign that comes to them from their Lord,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:47" />47: and when they are told, &lsquo;Give to others out of what God has provided for you,&rsquo; the disbelievers say to the believers, &lsquo;Why should we feed those that God could feed if He wanted? You must be deeply misguided.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:48" />48: And they say, &lsquo;When will this promise be fulfilled, if what you say is true?&rsquo;</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="36:50" />50: They will have no time to make bequests, nor will they have the chance to return to their own people.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="36:52" />52: They will say, &lsquo;Alas for us! Who has resurrected us from our resting places?&rsquo; [They will be told], &lsquo;This is what the Lord of Mercy promised, and the messengers told the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:53" />53: It was just one single blast and then- lo and behold!- they were all brought before Us.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:54" />54: &lsquo;Today, no soul will be wronged in the least: you will only be repaid for your deeds.</p>
