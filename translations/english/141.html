<p class="verse"><a name="6:102" />102: This is God, your Lord, there is no God but Him, the Creator of all things, so worship Him; He is in charge of everything.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:103" />103: No vision can take Him in, but He takes in all vision. He is the All Subtle, the All Aware.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:104" />104: Now clear proof has come to you from your Lord: if anyone sees it, that will be to his advantage; if anyone is blind to it, that will be to his loss- [Say], &lsquo;I am not your guardian.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:105" />105: This is how We explain Our revelations in various ways- though they will say, &lsquo;You [Muhammad] have been studying&rsquo;- to make them clear for those who know.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:106" />106: Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord, there is no God but Him. Turn away from those who join other gods with Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:107" />107: If it had been God&rsquo;s will, they would not have done so, but We have not made you their guardian, nor are you their keeper.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:108" />108: [Believers], do not revile those they call on beside God in case they, in their hostility and ignorance, revile God.

<p class="verse"><a name="6:109" />109: They swear by God with their most solemn oaths that if a miraculous sign came to them they would believe in it. Say [Prophet], &lsquo;Signs are in the power of God alone.&rsquo; What will make you [believers] realize that even if a sign came to them they still would not believe?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:110" />110: We would make their hearts and their eyes turn away, just as they did not believe the first time, and leave them to flounder in their obstinacy.</p>
