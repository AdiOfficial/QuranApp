<p class="verse"><a name="24:54" />54: Say, &lsquo;Obey God; obey the Messenger. If you turn away, [know that] he is responsible for the duty placed upon him, and you are responsible for the duty placed upon you. If you obey him, you will be rightly guided, but the Messenger&rsquo;s duty is only to deliver the message clearly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:55" />55: God has made a promise to those among you who believe and do good deeds: He will make them successors to the land, as He did those who came before them; He will empower the religion He has chosen for them; He will grant them security to replace their fear. &lsquo;They will worship Me and not join anything with Me.&rsquo; Those who are defiant after that will be the rebels.-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:56" />56: [People], keep up the prayer, pay the prescribed alms, and obey the Messenger, so that you may be given mercy.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:57" />57: Do not think [Prophet] that the disbelievers can escape God on earth; the Fire will be their final home, an evil end.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:58" />58: Believers, your slaves and any who have not yet reached puberty should ask your permission to come in at three times of day: before the dawn prayer; when you lay your garments aside in the midday heat; and after the evening prayer. These are your three times for privacy; at other times, there is no blame on you or them if you move around each other freely. In this way God makes messages clear: God is all knowing, all wise.</p>
