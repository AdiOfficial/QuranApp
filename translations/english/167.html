<p class="verse"><a name="7:138" />138: We took the Children of Israel across the sea, but when they came upon a people who worshipped idols, they said, &lsquo;Moses, make a god for us like theirs.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;You really are foolish people:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:139" />139: [the cult] these people practise is doomed to destruction, and what they have been doing is useless.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:140" />140: Why should I seek any god other than God for you, when He has favoured you over all other people?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:141" />141: Remember how We saved you from Pharaoh&rsquo;s people, who were subjecting you to the worst of sufferings, killing your male children, sparing only your females- that was a mighty ordeal from your Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:142" />142: We appointed thirty nights for Moses, then added ten more: the term set by his Lord was completed in forty nights. Moses said to his brother Aaron, &lsquo;Take my place among my people: act rightly and do not follow the way of those who spread corruption.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:143" />143: When Moses came for the appointment, and his Lord spoke to him, he said, &lsquo;My Lord, show Yourself to me: let me see You!&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;You will never see Me, but look at that mountain: if it remains standing firm, you will see Me,&rsquo; and when his Lord revealed Himself to the mountain, He made it crumble: Moses fell down unconscious. When he recovered, he said, &lsquo;Glory be to You! To You I turn in repentance! I am the first to believe!&rsquo;</p>
