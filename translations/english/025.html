<p class="verse"><a name="2:164" />164: In the creation of the heavens and earth; in the alternation of night and day; in the ships that sail the seas with goods for people; in the water which God sends down from the sky to give life to the earth when it has been barren, scattering all kinds of creatures over it; in the changing of the winds and clouds that run their appointed courses between the sky and earth: there are signs in all these for those who use their minds.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:165" />165: Even so, there are some who choose to worship others besides God as rivals to Him, loving them with the love due to God, but the believers have greater love for God. If only the idolaters could see- as they will see when they face the torment- that all power belongs to God, and that God punishes severely.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:166" />166: When those who have been followed disown their followers, when they all see the suffering, when all bonds between them are severed,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:167" />167: the followers will say, &lsquo;If only we had one last chance, we would disown them as they now disown us.&rsquo; In this way, God will make them see their deeds as a source of bitter regret: they shall not leave the Fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:168" />168: People, eat what is good and lawful from the earth, and do not follow Satan&rsquo;s footsteps, for he is your sworn enemy.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:169" />169: He always commands you to do what is evil and indecent, and to say things about God that you do not really know.</p>
