<p class="verse"><a name="40:67" />67: It is He who created you from dust, then from a drop of fluid, then from a tiny, clinging form, then He brought you forth as infants, then He allowed you to reach maturity, then He let you grow old- though some of you die sooner- and reach your appointed term so that you may reflect.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:68" />68: It is He who gives life and death, and when He ordains a thing, He says only &lsquo;Be&rsquo; and it is.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:69" />69: [Prophet], do you see how deluded those who dispute God&rsquo;s messages are-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:70" />70: those who reject the Scripture and the messages We have sent through Our messengers? They will find out</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:71" />71: when, with iron collars and chains around their necks, they are dragged</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:72" />72: into scalding water, and then burned in the Fire,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:73" />73: and asked, &lsquo;Where now are those you called upon</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:74" />74: besides God?&rsquo; They will say, &lsquo;They have abandoned us: those we called upon before were really nothing at all.&rsquo; &lsquo;This is how God lets disbelievers go astray,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:75" />75: all because on earth you revelled in untruth and ran wild.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:76" />76: Enter the gates of Hell, there to remain- an evil home for the arrogant.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:77" />77: So be patient [Prophet], for God&rsquo;s promise is sure: whether We show you part of what We have promised them in this life or whether We take your soul back to Us first, it is to Us that they will be returned.</p>
