<p class="verse"><a name="23:62" />62: We do not burden any soul with more than it can bear- We have a Record that tells the truth- they will not be wronged.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:63" />63: But the disbelievers&rsquo; hearts are steeped [in ignorance of ] all this; and there are other things besides this that they do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:64" />64: When We bring Our punishment on those corrupted with wealth, they will cry for help:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:65" />65: &lsquo;Do not cry out today: you will get no help from Us.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:66" />66: Time and time again My messages were recited to you, but you turned arrogantly on your heels,</p>
