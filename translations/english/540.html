<p class="verse"><a name="57:19" />19: Those who believe in God and His messengers are the truthful ones who will bear witness before their Lord: they will have their reward and their light. But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations are the inhabitants of Hell.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:20" />20: Bear in mind that the present life is just a game, a diversion, an attraction, a cause of boasting among you, of rivalry in wealth and children. It is like plants that spring up after the rain: their growth at first delights the sowers, but then you see them wither away, turn yellow, and become stubble. There is terrible punishment in the next life as well as forgiveness and approval from God; the life of this world is only an illusory pleasure.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:21" />21: So race for your Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness and a Garden as wide as the heavens and earth, prepared for those who believe in God and His messengers: that is God&rsquo;s bounty, which He bestows on whoever He pleases. God&rsquo;s bounty is infinite.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:22" />22: No misfortune can happen, either in the earth or in yourselves, that was not set down in writing before We brought it into being- that is easy for God-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:23" />23: so you need not grieve for what you miss or gloat over what you gain.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:24" />24: God does not love the conceited, the boastful, those who are miserly, and who tell other people to be miserly. If anyone turns away, remember that God is self-sufficient and worthy of praise.</p>
