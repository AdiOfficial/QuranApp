<p class="verse"><a name="49:12" />12: Believers, avoid making too many assumptions- some assumptions are sinful- and do not spy on one another or speak ill of people behind their backs: would any of you like to eat the flesh of your dead brother? No, you would hate it. So be mindful of God: God is ever relenting, most merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="49:13" />13: People, We created you all from a single man and a single woman, and made you into races and tribes so that you should recognize one another. In God&rsquo;s eyes, the most honoured of you are the ones most mindful of Him: God is all knowing, all aware.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="49:14" />14: The desert Arabs say, &lsquo;We have faith.&rsquo; [Prophet], tell them, &lsquo;You do not have faith. What you should say instead is, &ldquo;We have submitted,&rdquo; for faith has not yet entered your hearts.&rsquo; If you obey God and His Messenger, He will not diminish any of your deeds: He is most forgiving and most merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="49:15" />15: The true believers are the ones who have faith in God and His Messenger and leave all doubt behind, the ones who have struggled with their possessions and their persons in God&rsquo;s way: they are the ones who are true.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="49:16" />16: Say, &lsquo;Do you presume to teach God about your religion, when God knows everything in the heavens and earth, and He has full knowledge of all things?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="49:17" />17: They think they have done you [Prophet] a favour by submitting. Say, &lsquo;Do not consider your submission a favour to me; it is God who has done you a favour, by guiding you to faith, if you are truly sincere.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="49:18" />18: God knows the secrets of the heavens and earth: He sees everything you do.</p>
