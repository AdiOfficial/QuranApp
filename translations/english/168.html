<p class="verse"><a name="7:144" />144: He said, &lsquo;Moses, I have raised you above other people by [giving you] My messages and speaking to you: hold on to what I have given you; be one of those who give thanks.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:145" />145: We inscribed everything for him in the Tablets which taught and explained everything, saying, &lsquo;Hold on to them firmly and urge your people to hold fast to their excellent teachings. I will show you the end of those who rebel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:146" />146: I will keep distracted from My signs those who behave arrogantly on Earth without any right, and who, even if they see every sign, will not believe in them; they will not take the way of right guidance if they see it, but will take the way of error if they see that. This is because they denied Our signs and paid them no heed:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:147" />147: the deeds of those who denied Our signs and the Meeting of the Hereafter will come to nothing- why should they be repaid for anything other than what they have done?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:148" />148: In his absence, Moses&rsquo; people took to worshipping a mere shape that made sounds like a cow- a calf made from their jewellery. Could they not see that it did not speak to them or guide them in any way? Yet they took it for worship: they were evildoers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:149" />149: When, with much wringing of hands, they perceived that they were doing wrong, they said, &lsquo;If our Lord does not have mercy and forgive us, we shall be the losers.&rsquo;</p>
