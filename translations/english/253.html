<p class="verse"><a name="13:29" />29: those who believe and do righteous deeds: joy awaits these, and their final homecoming will be excellent.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:30" />30: So We have sent you [Prophet] to a community- other communities passed away long before them- to recite to them what We reveal to you. Yet they disbelieve in the Lord of Mercy. Say, &lsquo;He is my Lord: there is no god but Him. I put my trust in Him and to Him is my return.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:31" />31: If there were ever to be a Quran with which mountains could be moved, the earth shattered, or the dead made to speak [it would have been this one], but everything is truly in God&rsquo;s hands. Do the believers not realize that if God had so willed, He could have guided all mankind? As for the disbelievers, because of their misdeeds, disaster will not cease to afflict them or fall close to their homes until God&rsquo;s promise is fulfilled: God never fails to keep His promise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:32" />32: Many messengers before you [Muhammad] were mocked, but I granted respite to the disbelievers: in the end, I took them to task- how terrible My punishment was!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:33" />33: Is He who stands over every soul marking its action [in need of any partner]? Yet they ascribe partners to God. Say, &lsquo;Name them,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Can you tell Him about something on the earth He does not know to exist, or is this just a display of words?&rsquo; But the things they devise are made alluring to the disbelievers and they are barred from the [right] path: no one can guide those God leaves to stray.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:34" />34: There is a punishment for them in this world, but the punishment of the Hereafter will be harder- no one will defend them against God.</p>
