<p class="verse"><a name="7:68" />68: I am delivering my Lord&rsquo;s messages to you. I am your sincere and honest adviser.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:69" />69: Do you find it so strange that a message should come from your Lord, through a man in your midst, to warn you? Remember how He made you heirs after Noah&rsquo;s people, and increased your stature: remember God&rsquo;s bounties, so that you may prosper.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:70" />70: They said, &lsquo;Have you really come to tell us to serve God alone and to forsake what our forefathers served? If what you say is true, bring us the punishment you threaten.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:71" />71: He said, &lsquo;You are already set to receive your Lord&rsquo;s loathing and anger. Are you arguing with me about mere names you and your forefathers invented, names for which God has given no sanction? Just wait; I too am waiting.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:72" />72: We saved him, and those who were with him, through Our mercy; We destroyed those who denied Our revelations and would not believe.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:73" />73: To the people of Thamud We sent their brother, Salih. He said, &lsquo;My people, serve God: you have no god other than Him. A clear sign has come to you now from your Lord: this is God&rsquo;s she-camel- a sign for you- so let her graze in God&rsquo;s land and do not harm her in any way, or you will be struck by a painful torment.</p>
