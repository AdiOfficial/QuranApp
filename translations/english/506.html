<p class="verse"><a name="46:29" />29: We sent a group of jinn to you [Prophet] to listen to the Quran. When they heard it, they said to one another, &lsquo;Be quiet!&rsquo; Then when it was finished they turned to their community and gave them warning.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:30" />30: They said, &lsquo;Our people, we have been listening to a Scripture that came after Moses, confirming previous scriptures, giving guidance to the truth and the straight path.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:31" />31: Our people, respond to the one who calls you to God. Believe in Him: He will forgive you your sins and protect you from a painful torment.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:32" />32: Those who fail to respond to God&rsquo;s call cannot escape God&rsquo;s power anywhere on earth, nor will they have any protector against Him: such people have clearly gone far astray.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:33" />33: Do the disbelievers not understand that God, who created the heavens and earth and did not tire in doing so, has the power to bring the dead back to life? Yes indeed! He has power over everything.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:34" />34: On the Day the disbelievers are brought before Hell [it will be said to them], &lsquo;Is this not real?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, by our Lord,&rsquo; they will reply and He will say, &lsquo;Then taste the punishment for having denied the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="46:35" />35: Be steadfast [Muhammad], like those messengers of firm resolve. Do not seek to hasten the punishment for the disbelievers: on the Day they see what they had been warned about, it will seem to them that they lingered no more than a single hour of a single day [in this life]. This is a warning. Shall any be destroyed except the defiant?</p>
