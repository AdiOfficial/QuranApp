<p class="verse"><a name="4:135" />135: You who believe, uphold justice and bear witness to God, even if it is against yourselves, your parents, or your close relatives. Whether the person is rich or poor, God can best take care of both. Refrain from following your own desire, so that you can act justly- if you distort or neglect justice, God is fully aware of what you do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:136" />136: You who believe, believe in God and His Messenger and in the Scripture He sent down to His Messenger, as well as what He sent down before. Anyone who does not believe in God, His angels, His Scriptures, His messengers, and the Last Day has gone far, far astray.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:137" />137: As for those who believe, then reject the faith, then believe again, then reject the faith again and become increasingly defiant, God will not forgive them, nor will He guide them on any path.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:138" />138: [Prophet], tell such hypocrites that an agonizing torment awaits them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:139" />139: Do those who ally themselves with the disbelievers rather than the believers seek power through them? In reality all power is God&rsquo;s to give.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:140" />140: As He has already revealed to you [believers] in the Scripture, if you hear people denying and ridiculing God&rsquo;s revelation, do not sit with them unless they start to talk of other things, or else you yourselves will become like them: God will gather all the hypocrites and disbelievers together into Hell.</p>
