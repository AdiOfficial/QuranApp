<p class="verse"><a name="30:42" />42: Say, &lsquo;Travel through the land, and see how those before you met their end- most of them were idolaters.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:43" />43: [Prophet], stand firm in your devotion to the upright religion, before an irresistible Day comes from God. On that Day, mankind will be divided:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:44" />44: those who rejected the truth will bear the burden of that rejection, and those who did good deeds will have made good provision for themselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:45" />45: From His bounty God will reward those who believe and do good deeds; He does not like those who reject the truth.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:46" />46: Another of His signs is that He sends out the winds bearing good news, giving you a taste of His grace, making the ships sail at His command, enabling you to [journey in] search of His bounty so that you may be grateful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:47" />47: Before you [Muhammad], We sent mes-sengers, each to their own people: they brought them clear proofs and then We punished the evildoers. We make it Our duty to help the believers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:48" />48: It is God who sends out the winds; they stir up the clouds; He spreads them over the skies as He pleases; He makes them break up and you see the rain falling from them. See how they rejoice when He makes it fall upon whichever of His servants He wishes,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:49" />49: though before it is sent they may have lost all hope.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="30:50" />50: Look, then, at the imprints of God&rsquo;s mercy, how He restores the earth to life after death: this same God is the one who will return people to life after death- He has power over all things.</p>
