<p class="verse"><a name="26:1" />1: Ta Sin Mim</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:2" />2: These are the verses of the Scripture that makes things clear:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:3" />3: [Prophet], are you going to worry yourself to death because they will not believe?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:4" />4: If We had wished, We could have sent them down a sign from heaven, at which their necks would stay bowed in utter humility.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:5" />5: Whenever they are brought a new revelation from the Lord of Mercy, they turn away:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:6" />6: they deny it, but the truth of what they scorned will soon hit them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:7" />7: Do they not see the earth, and what noble kinds of thing We grow in it?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:8" />8: There truly is a sign in this, though most of them do not believe:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:9" />9: your Lord alone is the Almighty, the Merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:10" />10: Your Lord called to Moses: &lsquo;Go to those wrongdoers,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:11" />11: the people of Pharaoh. Will they not take heed?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:12" />12: Moses said, &lsquo;My Lord, I fear they will call me a liar,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:13" />13: and I will feel stressed and tongue-tied, so send Aaron too;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:14" />14: besides, they have a chargeagainst me, and I fear they may kill me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:15" />15: God said, &lsquo;No [they will not]. Go, both of you, with Our signs&ndash;&ndash;We shall be with you, listen-ing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:16" />16: Go, both of you, to Pharaoh and say, &ldquo;We bring a message from the Lord of the Worlds:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:17" />17: let the Children of Israel leave with us.&rdquo; &rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:18" />18: Pharaoh said, &lsquo;Did we not bring you up as a child among us? Did you not stay with us for many years?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:19" />19: And then you committed that crime of yours: you were so ungrateful.&rsquo;</p>
