<p class="verse"><a name="9:107" />107: Then there are those who built a mosque&ndash;&ndash;in an attempt to cause harm, disbelief, and disunity among the believers&ndash;&ndash;as an outpost for those who fought God and His Messenger before: they swear, &lsquo;Our intentions were nothing but good,&rsquo; but God bears witness that they are liars.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:108" />108: [Prophet], never pray in that mosque. You should rather pray in a mosque founded from its first day on consciousness of God: in this mosque there are men who desire to grow in purity- God loves those who seek to purify themselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:109" />109: Which is better, the person who founds his building on consciousness of God and desire for His good pleasure, or the person who founds his building on the brink of a crumbling precipice that will tumble down into the Fire of Hell, taking him with it? God does not guide the evildoers:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:110" />110: the building they have founded will always be a source of doubt within their hearts, until their hearts are cut to pieces. God is all knowing and wise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:111" />111: God has purchased the persons and possessions of the believers in return for the Garden- they fight in God&rsquo;s way: they kill and are killed- this is a true promise given by Him in the Torah, the Gospel, and the Quran. Who could be more faithful to his promise than God? So be happy with the bargain you have made: that is the supreme triumph.</p>
