<p class="verse"><a name="7:105" />105: duty-bound to say nothing about God but the truth, and I have brought you a clear sign from your Lord. Let the Children of Israel go with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:106" />106: He said, &lsquo;Produce this sign you have brought, if you are telling the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:107" />107: So Moses threw his staff and- lo and behold!- it was a snake, clear to all,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:108" />108: and then he pulled out his hand and- lo and behold!- it was white for all to see.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:109" />109: The leaders among Pharaoh&rsquo;s people said, &lsquo;This man is a learned sorcerer!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:110" />110: He means to drive you out of your land!&rsquo; Pharaoh said, &lsquo;What do you suggest?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:111" />111: They said, &lsquo;Delay him and his brother for a while, and send messengers to all the cities</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:112" />112: to summon every learned sorcerer to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:113" />113: The sorcerers came to Pharaoh and said, &lsquo;Shall we be rewarded if we win?&rsquo;</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="7:117" />117: Then We inspired Moses, &lsquo;Throw your staff,&rsquo; and- lo and behold!&ndash;&ndash;it devoured their fakery.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:118" />118: The truth was confirmed and what they had produced came to nothing:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:119" />119: they were defeated there and utterly humiliated.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:120" />120: The sorcerers fell to their knees</p>
