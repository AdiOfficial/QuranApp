<p class="verse"><a name="39:22" />22: What about the one whose heart God has opened in devotion to Him, so that he walks in light from his Lord? Alas for those whose hearts harden at the mention of God! They have clearly lost their way.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="39:27" />27: In this Quran, We have put forward all kinds of illustration for people, so that they may take heed-</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="39:29" />29: God puts forward this illustration: can a man who has for his masters several partners at odds with each other be considered equal to a man devoted wholly to one master? All praise belongs to God, though most of them do not know.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="39:30" />30: You [Prophet] will certainly die, and so will they,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="39:31" />31: and, on the Day of Resurrection, you will dispute with one another in the presence of your Lord.</p>
