<p class="verse"><a name="40:26" />26: and Pharaoh said, &lsquo;Leave me to kill Moses- let him call upon his Lord!- for I fear he may cause you to change your religion, or spread disorder in the land.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:27" />27: Moses said, &lsquo;I seek refuge with my Lord and yours from every tyrant who refuses to believe in the Day of Reckoning.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:28" />28: A secret believer from Pharaoh&rsquo;s family said, &lsquo;How can you kill a man just for saying, &ldquo;My Lord is God&rdquo;? He has brought you clear signs from your Lord- if he is a liar, on his own head be it- and if he is truthful, then at least some of what he has threatened will happen to you. God does not guide any rebellious, outrageous liar.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:29" />29: My people, as masters in the land you have the power today, but who will help us against God&rsquo;s might if it comes upon us?&rsquo; But Pharaoh said, &lsquo;I have told you what I think; I am guiding you along the right path.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:30" />30: The believer said, &lsquo;My people, I fear your fate will be the fate of those others who opposed [their prophets]:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:31" />31: the fate of the people of Noah, Ad, Thamud, and those who came after them- God never wills injustice on His creatures.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:32" />32: My people, I fear for you on the Day you will cry out to one another,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="40:33" />33: the Day you will turn tail and flee with no one to defend you from God! Whoever God leaves to stray will have no one to guide him.</p>
