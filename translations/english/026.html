<p class="verse"><a name="2:174" />174: As for those who conceal the Scripture that God sent down and sell it for a small price, they only fill their bellies with Fire. God will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them: an agonizing torment awaits them.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="2:176" />176: This is because God has sent the Scripture with the Truth; those who pursue differences in the Scripture are deeply entrenched in opposition.</p>
