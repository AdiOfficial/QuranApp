<p class="verse"><a name="10:79" />79: And Pharaoh said, &lsquo;Bring me every learned sorcerer.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:80" />80: When the sorcerers came, Moses said to them, &lsquo;Throw down whatever you have.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:81" />81: When they did so, Moses said, &lsquo;Everything you have brought is sorcery and God will show it to be false. God does not make the work of mischief-makers right;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:82" />82: He will uphold the Truth with His words, even if the evildoers hate it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:83" />83: But no one believed in Moses except a few of his own people, for fear that Pharaoh and their leaders would persecute them: Pharaoh was domineering in the land and prone to excess.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:84" />84: Moses said, &lsquo;My people, if you have faith in God and are devoted to Him, put your trust in Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:85" />85: They said, &lsquo;We have put our trust in God. Lord! Do not make us an object of persecution for the oppressors.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:86" />86: Save us, in Your mercy, from those who reject [Your message].&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:87" />87: We revealed to Moses and his brother: &lsquo;House your people in Egypt and make these houses places of worship; keep up the prayer; give good news to the believers!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:88" />88: And Moses said, &lsquo;Our Lord, You have given Pharaoh and his chiefs splendour and wealth in this present life and here they are, Lord, leading others astray from Your path. Our Lord, obliterate their wealth and harden their hearts so that they do not believe until they see the agonizing torment.&rsquo;</p>
