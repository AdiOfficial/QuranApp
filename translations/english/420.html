<p class="verse"><a name="33:16" />16: [Prophet], say, &lsquo;Running away will not benefit you. If you manage to escape death or slaughter, you will only be permitted to enjoy [life] for a short while.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:17" />17: Say, &lsquo;If God wishes to harm you, who can protect you? If God wishes to show you mercy, who can prevent Him?&rsquo; They will find no one but God to protect or help them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:18" />18: God knows exactly who among you hinder others, who [secretly] say to their brothers, &lsquo;Come and join us,&rsquo; who hardly ever come out to fight,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:19" />19: who begrudge you [believers] any help. When fear comes, you [Prophet] see them looking at you with eyes rolling like someone in their death throes; when fear has passed, they attack you with sharp tongues and begrudge you any good. Such men do not believe, and God brings their deeds to nothing- that is all too easy for God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:20" />20: They think the joint forces have not gone, and if the joint forces did come again they would wish they were in the desert, wandering among the Bedouin and seeking news about you [from a safe distance]. Even if they were with you [believers], they would hardly fight at all.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:21" />21: The Messenger of God is an excellent model for those of you who put your hope in God and the Last Day and remember Him often.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:22" />22: When the believers saw the joint forces, they said, &lsquo;This is what God and His Messenger promised us: the promise of God and His Messenger is true,&rsquo; and this only served to increase their faith and submission to God.</p>
