<p class="verse"><a name="9:73" />73: Prophet, strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be tough with them. Hell is their final home- an evil destin-ation!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:74" />74: They swear by God that they did not, but they certainly did speak words of defiance and became defiant after having submitted; they tried to do something, though they did not achieve it, &ndash;&ndash;being spiteful was their only response to God and His Messenger enriching them out of His bounty. They would be better off turning back [to God]: if they turn away, God will punish them in this world and the Hereafter, and there will be no one on earth to protect or help them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:75" />75: There are some among them who pledged themselves to God, saying, &lsquo;If God gives us some of His bounty, we shall certainly give alms and be righteous,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:76" />76: yet when He did give them some of His bounty, they became mean and turned obstinately away.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:77" />77: Because they broke their promise to God, because of all the lies they told, He made hypocrisy settle in their hearts until the Day they meet Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:78" />78: Do they not realize that God knows their secrets and their private discussions? That God knows all that is hidden?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="9:79" />79: It is they who criticize the believers who give freely and those who can only give a little with great effort: they scoff at such people, but it is God who scoffs at them- a painful punishment awaits them.</p>
