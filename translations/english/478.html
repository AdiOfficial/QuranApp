<p class="verse"><a name="41:12" />12: and in two Days He formed seven heavens, and assigned an order to each. We have made the nearest one beautifully illuminated and secure. Such is the design of the Almighty, the All Knowing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="41:13" />13: If they turn away, say, &lsquo;I have warned you about a blast like the one which struck 'Ad and Thamud:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="41:14" />14: when their messengers came to them, from all angles, saying, &ldquo;Serve no one but God,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;If our Lord had wished, He would have sent down angels. We do not believe in the message with which you have been sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="41:15" />15: The people of 'Ad behaved arrogantly throughout the land without any right, saying, &ldquo;Who could be stronger than us?&rdquo; Did they not realize that God, who created them, was stronger than them?&rsquo; They continued to reject Our message,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="41:16" />16: so We let a roaring wind loose on them for a few disastrous days to make them taste the punishment of shame in this world; more shameful still will be the punishment of the life to come, and they will not be helped.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="41:17" />17: As for Thamud, We gave them guidance but they preferred blindness, so they were struck by a blast of humiliating punishment for their misdeeds.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="41:18" />18: We saved those who believed and were mindful of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="41:19" />19: On the Day when God&rsquo;s enemies are gathered up for the Fire and driven onward,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="41:20" />20: their ears, eyes, and skins will, when they reach it, testify against them for their misdeeds.</p>
