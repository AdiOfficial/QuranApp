<p class="verse"><a name="6:91" />91: They have no grasp of God&rsquo;s true measure when they say, &lsquo;God has sent nothing down to a mere mortal.&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;Who was it who sent down the Scripture, which Moses brought as a light and a guide to people, which you made into separate sheets, showing some but hiding many? You were taught things that neither you nor your forefathers had known.&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;God [sent it down],&rsquo; then leave them engrossed in their vain talk.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:92" />92: This is a blessed Scripture that We have sent down to confirm what came before it and for you to warn the Mother of Cities and all around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in this Scripture, and do not neglect their prayers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:93" />93: Who could be more wicked than someone who invents a lie against God, or claims, &lsquo;A revelation has come to me,&rsquo; when no revelation has been sent to him, or says, &lsquo;I too can reveal something equal to God&rsquo;s revelation&rsquo;? If you could only see the wicked in their death agonies, as the angels stretch out their hands [to them], saying, &lsquo;Give up your souls. Today you will be repaid with a humiliating punishment for saying false things about God and for arrogantly rejecting His revelations.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:94" />94: [God will say], &lsquo;Now you return to Us, alone, as We first created you: you have left behind everything We gave you, nor do We see those intercessors of yours that you claimed were partners of God. All the bonds between you have been severed, and those about whom you made such claims have deserted you.&rsquo;</p>
